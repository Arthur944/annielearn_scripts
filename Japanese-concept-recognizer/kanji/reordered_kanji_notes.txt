人;person;The character for _enter_ (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for **person** , shown here, represents someone walking outwards.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 27-11-2008(156): Behold Mister T (of "A-Team" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he's sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he's both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” **person** , telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 1-10-2006(44): [I appreciate some people's occasional habit of using _P_ for **person** in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute _Mr. T_ , _Captain Picard_ , or whomever else a student is using as **person.** ].
一;one;In Chinese characters, the number **one** is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right.;1) [[Piitaa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa)] 29-6-2006(263): **One** down, 2041 to go. ,).;2) [[findus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus)] 11-5-2008(98): To learn this **one** kanji, I [recommend](../v4/2000.html) (#2000 薦) this story : _Bambi_ is in a _cave_ , eating a side-dish of _salad_ when trying to learn the kanjis. As he succeed to learn the kanji for "one", you get jealous and decide to shoot him with a _slingshot_. At this moment you hear the police coming, so you hurriedly burn all the proofs into a _fire_ (so you remove the key-words _Bambi_ , _slingshot_ and _fire_ from _recommend_ ). So that when the police arrives, the only remaining clue is a single horizontal bar.
見;see;The elements that compose the character for **see** are the _eye_ firmly fixed to a pair of _human legs_. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 29-6-2007(146): As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc. (the giant _eyeball_ with _legs_ …) Makes for _easy_ stories later on.;2) [[frenchdonuts](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frenchdonuts)] 24-6-2008(124): Eyes and legs are all you need to **see** the world.
出;exit;The kanji for **exit** pictures a series of mountain peaks coming out of the _earth_. Learn it together with the following frame.;1) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 4-1-2008(141): Suddenly, a _cactus_ comes out of the ground with a sign that reads: **exit**. Now you can leave the desert! (Note: giving this primitive the meaning 'cactus' can be useful later).;2) [[theBryan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theBryan)] 19-7-2008(63): The **exit** lays between these two mountains.
日;day;This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, "Have a nice **day**! ";1) [[Alphinux](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alphinux)] 23-1-2008(120): Open the window, new **day**.;2) [[ibnfe2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ibnfe2)] 30-12-2006(18): Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: **Day** & Night.
来;come;This odd but common kanji is built up of the character for _not yet_ into which a pair of _animal horns_ has been inserted.;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 22-2-2007(346): You _horny_ bastard, don't **come** , at least _not yet_!;2) [[volfy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy)] 12-5-2006(72): When I **come** home, there's nobody and no dinner waiting for me. Sigh… _rice_ for _one_ again.
大;large;Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of **large**. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.;1) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 13-9-2007(79): A person stretching their arms and legs to look **large** and scare a bear away.;2) [[Teango](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango)] 8-3-2010(23): How **large**? This **large**!
子;child;This kanji is a pictograph of a **child** wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young **children** who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air, the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up, and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.;1) [[lbphenom](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lbphenom)] 12-1-2008(43): A **child** who is _ten_ will still ask for his _ma_ (top looks a bit like katakana ma).;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 28-1-2008(30): A pictograph of a **child** , with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).
思;think;Brains . . . heart.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 8-7-2006(237): **Think** with your _brain_ NOT your _heart_.;2) [[PacifistGod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod)] 8-4-2007(153): To **think** is to use your brain over your heart.
行;going;By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for **going**.;1) [[jackhuddleston](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston)] 3-5-2008(76): To me, this looks like a bridge **going** over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and **going** constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.;2) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 4-11-2005(53): I use _The Flash_ for for this primitive, a superhero who is always _going_ very fast.
時;time;"What is **time**? " asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. "Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you." Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. **Time** is a _sun_ rising over a _Buddhist temple_. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character.;1) [[zdnks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdnks)] 31-10-2007(120): When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it's **time** to get up.;2) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 27-2-2008(102): In ancient Japan, **TIME** of ''day'' was announced at the ''buddhist temples''. They did this by ringing large iron bells. This is similar to churches who ring their bells to announce the **time** of day.
上;above;The two directions, **above** and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a _magic wand_ standing **_above_** a _floor_  \- "magically," you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words **above** and _below_ suggest each other.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(58): A _magic wand_ standing on **above** the floor.;2) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(18): The _divining rod_ is **above** the _floor_.
分;part;Go in . . . dagger.;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 4-1-2007(159): When something is _entered_ by a _dagger_ , it ends up being cut in several **parts**.;2) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 21-3-2008(147): (This kanji also has the meanings of "understand" and "minute"). It's important to understand that were you to _enter_ an hour with a _dagger_ and cut it into **parts** , those **parts** would be minutes.
私;private;_Wheat_ . . . _elbow_. Like the characters for I (Frame 17) and _ego_ (Frame 690), this kanji is also representative of the subject, with the special connotation of **privacy**.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 1-5-2006(294): Warning sign: "Private wheat, trespassers will be elbowed".;2) [[hilber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hilber)] 12-12-2009(114): A joke so bad as "wheatashi wa" deserves an elbow in the **private** parts.
中;in;The elements here are a _walking stick_ and a _mouth_. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine **in** your _mouth_? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's _walking stick_ , to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something **in** from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil **in** to a baby's mouth.;1) [[Rose_Arteth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rose_Arteth)] 17-8-2007(143): Pocky goes **in** the mouth.;2) [[samesong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong)] 22-3-2009(116): My GF lets me come **in** her mouth (pictogram).
事;matter;This key word here refers to abstract **matters**. The elements are: _one_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _rake_. Note how the _rake_ handle reaches out the top and bottom of the character.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 16-9-2007(216): Just _one_ word about this **matter** from your _mouth_ and you will find this _rake_ across it.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 18-11-2007(109): I had to take _one_ day off from work due to 'personal **matter** s' after stepping on a _rake_ and having the handle snap up and smack me across the _mouth_. I certainly wasn't going to tell anyone about it.
何;what;Person . . . can.;1) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 22-1-2008(157): **What** can Mr T do? 'You mean: **what** can't MR T do, you fool'.;2) [[msukovich](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/msukovich)] 6-5-2008(44): " **What** country you from?" " **W-what**?" "' **What** ' ain't no country I ever heard of, they speak English in ' **What** '?" " **W-w-what**?" "ENGLISH, MOTHERFUCKER, _CAN_ YOU SPEAK IT?" "Yes!" "Now describe **what** this _person_ Marsellus Wallace looks like!" " **W-w-w-what**?" "Say ' **what** ' again! SAY ' **WHAT** ' AGAIN! I dare you! I double-dare you, motherfucker! Say ' **what** ' one more god-damn time!".
二;two;Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for **two** is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter.;1) [[kiisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu)] 15-1-2008(54): **Two** lines.;2) [[mazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel)] 10-9-2006(24): Roman numeral II, written on its side.
自;oneself;You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little _drop_ that Mother Nature set between your _eyes_. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for **oneself**.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(140): To use an eyedropper by **oneself** , aim from _above_ to put a _drop_ into the _eye_.;2) [[pikako](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pikako)] 14-11-2007(89): Faced with his clone, our hero valiantly cut a _mark_ on his forehead right above his _eye_ so that his comrades could tell his true **oneself** from the enemy.
彼;he;_Going_ . . . _pelt_. This kanji refers to the third person singular personal pronoun, generally in its masculine form.;1) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 28-5-2007(309): What's the main difference between a **he** and a she? The **he** has a _column_ covered in a _pelt_ … a penis. Badum-ching.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 8-1-2008(58): The ultimate **he** -man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar ( _column_ ), and **he** wears a ragged _pelt_ as his only clothing. To remember the _column_ , imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.
方;direction;Spinning a _dagger_ about on its hilt on the top of a _top hat_  \- waiting to see in which **direction** it points when it comes to rest - one leaves to fate where one is going next. Take care in writing this character.;1) [[Deonnn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deonnn)] 9-12-2007(147): Note: The primitives are _top hat_ and _bound up_. Compare [ten thousand](../v4/64.html) (#64 万). Story: A rich man wearing a _top hat_ and _bound up_ from head to toe hobbles up to you and asks for **directions** to the nearest police station because he just escaped from his kidnappers.;2) [[CSBarnes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CSBarnes)] 15-12-2008(49): I always keep my **directions** _bound_ to the bottom of my _top hat_ so I won't lose them.
生;life;A single _drop_ added to the element for _grow up_ gives us the character for **life**.;1) [[TheSleeve](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve)] 5-11-2007(221): This is the first CELL of a human, the foundation of its entire **LIFE** , a small DROP that will GROW UP to form a complex organism.;2) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 19-12-2007(29): Growing Up is just a Drop of our **LIFE**.
間;interval;_Gates_ . . . _sun/day_. This **interval** applies to time and space alike, but the latter is better for creating an image.;1) [[shaydwyrm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm)] 28-6-2007(203): The **interval** between star systems ( _suns_ ) was too large, so the star _gates_ were created to travel between them.;2) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 16-2-2009(95): We open the _gates_ at regular **intervals** to let a bit of _sun_ in.
手;hand;Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a **hand** in this character. But that it is, and so you must.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 31-1-2007(99): This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a **hand** with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 4-8-2009(86): A **hand** is useful for 千一 (1001) things.
言;say;Of all the things we can do with our _mouths_ , speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for **say** has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement.;1) [[jinka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinka)] 28-4-2006(109): A pictogram of someone **saying** a _four_ letter word from their _mouth_ after the censors have gotten a hold of it.;2) [[sethg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg)] 4-2-2009(68): This is simple a pictogram of a _mouth_ **SAY** ing something. The lines are soundwaves. No need to complicate it.
女;woman;You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting **woman** drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy, being able to write it beautifully is another thing.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 14-1-2007(216): To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a "kunoichi". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一 (kanji, ichi=one).;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(29): My mother taught me that a **woman** should always sit with her legs crossed (but the arms can be stretched out).
本;book;Recalling that **books** are made of paper, and paper made of _trees_ , one might think of a **book** as a slice of a _tree_. Can you seethe  "cross-cut" in the trunk of the _tree_? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few **books** with which to start your own private library.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(73): The origin of a **book** is paper made out of TREEs. ONE tree can make many **book** s.;2) [[ggwar](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ggwar)] 7-8-2009(25): A **book** is _one_ slice of a _tree_.
気;spirit;The **spirit** in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: _reclining_ . . . _floor_ . . . _fishhook_ . . . _sheaf_. Do not confuse with _spirits_ (Frame 1930).;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(130): _Captain Hook_ , his **spirit** crushed, is lying on the ground cursing _Wolverine_ who has defeated him with his far superior claws.;2) [[Balaam](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam)] 2-2-2008(57): You're reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you've been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning **spirit**.
年;year;In an odd fashion, the kanji for **year** joins together the element for _horse_ , on the top, and the right half of the element for _sunglasses_. Think of it as a _horse_ wearing _sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out_. We will use this latter image again, so learn it now and save yourself the trouble later.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 21-3-2007(149): A _horse_ wears a pair of _sunglasses with one lens popped out_ after a particularly raucous celebration to ring in the New **Year**.;2) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 15-4-2008(63): A **horse** wears a **monocle** for New **Year** s to appear dignified for the **year** of the horse. ――one lens = monocle, you will encounter this again in kanji like [descend](../v4/1308.html) (#1308 降).
三;three;And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for **three** simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of "1 + 2 = 3" (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(68): One + two = **three**.;2) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 26-5-2009(49): **THREE** measurements define the female shape: BUST, WAIST, and HIPS. Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.
者;someone;_Old man_ . . . _sun_. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to _somebody_. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun  "something.";1) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 24-8-2007(196): I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for **ninja** : 忍者 – i.e. **someone** who **endures** (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍 ). A 忍者 is not just a 身 (somebody), it's 者 who can 忍 great 拷 !;2) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 20-1-2007(72): Back in the _day_ , the _old man_ used to be **someone**. His name was in the papers and all that. I use CHUCKY from the movie Child's Play as my major alternate meaning for this primitive.
十;ten;Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral **ten**.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(68): Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for **ten** (rotated 45 degrees).;2) [[naur_caraniril](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/naur_caraniril)] 11-10-2008(47): I scared away **ten** vampires with a single cross!
前;in front;We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the _butcher_ hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's _horns_ placed **in front** of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for _before_ (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.;1) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 26-12-2007(354): When I get _horn_ y my _flesh sword_ sticks out **in front** of me.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(74): If you stand **in front** of a bull's _horns_ , you are asking for your _flesh_ to be _cut_ (or _butchered_ if you prefer).
家;house;This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the "domestic" animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the **house**. Hence: _house_ . . . _sow_.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 1-11-2006(245): Think of "The Three Little Pigs". There was a _house_ made of straw, another made of sticks, and a third made of bricks, each occupied by a _pig_. So, naturally, _housetop_ over _pig_ means **house** , the central element of that story.;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 10-2-2008(41): Man, ever hear of cleaning? This **house** is a _pig_ sty.
心;heart;This character, a pictographic representation of the **heart** , is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet.;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 25-12-2008(60): (mature content: violence) I hung the **heart** of my victim with a _hook_ and three _drops_ of blood spattered me.;2) [[oRis1024](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024)] 15-8-2008(30): **Heart** needs three drops of blood to work.
今;now;The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes - for instance, as the second stroke of _mouth_. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is **now**. The element above it, _meeting_ , should easily relate to that image.;1) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 7-8-2007(230): My MEETING is at 7- but that's **NOW**!;2) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 7-9-2007(32): (re: ruuku35) The _meeting_ is not at _quarter to seven_ but **now**!
下;below;Here we see our famous miraculous _magic wand_ hanging, all on its own, **below** the _ceiling_ , as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for _ceiling_ and _floor_ , by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and **below** the primitive element to which it is related.;1) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(77): Roots are **below** the ground.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(48): A _magic wand_ hanging **below** the ceiling.
的;bull´s eye;The elements _white bird_ and _ladle_ easily suggest the image of a **bull's eye** if you imagine a rusty old _ladle_ with a **bull's eye** painted on it in the form of a tiny _white bird_ , who lets out a little "peep" every time you hit the target.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 22-7-2007(223): I managed to hit the bull's eye by throwing my white ladle.;2) [[seanolan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seanolan)] 10-10-2006(167): A _white_ , _bound up_ , _drop_ in the center is the bull's eye. (why Heisig had to use "ladle" instead of the original two primitives that make up "ladle" I'll never understand!).
物;thing;Cow . . . knot.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 18-6-2007(190): The _cow_ 's " **thing** " is tied in a _knot_! ouch.;2) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 3-12-2005(160): A _cow_ is _not_ a **thing**. Its an animal. If you study japanese you know that living beings and **thing** s are discerned from each other with the verbs iru and aru.
立;stand up;This picture of a vase **standing up** has its meaning extended to represent the general posture of anything **standing up**.;1) [[kitchen_sink](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kitchen_sink)] 14-8-2007(88): A vase that can't **stand up** won't be a vase for long.;2) [[andrewlandry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andrewlandry)] 30-3-2009(26): This is a real **stand up** vase. It even wears a top hat!
小;little;The sense of **little** that this character represents is not the same as  "a little bit." That meaning comes in the next frame. Here **little** means "small" or "tiny." The image is one of three **little** _drops_ , the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: **little** , **little** , nothing but **little**.;1) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 3-9-2008(121): A **little** penguin with its wings at its side.;2) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 13-9-2007(37): A depressed child, head low and arms hung low, because he's too **little** to ride the roller coaster.
文;sentence;Under the familiar _top hat_ we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with **sentence** by thinking of a **sentence** as a grammatical pattern.;1) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 4-1-2007(183): A twist on greenapple: The teacher puts a tophat on all pupils with gramatically correct **sentence** s, while the rest are left with a big red X on their homework.;2) [[greenapple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple)] 2-5-2006(60): The teacher in the tophat puts an X on all the grammatically incorrect **sentence** s.
知;know;Dart . . . mouth.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 10-7-2006(287): I should _know_. After all, I did graduate from **Dart** **mouth**!;2) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 21-9-2006(133): [know, wisdom] [An arrow 矢 like mouth 口 ] If you **know** the answers, they will fly like _dart_ s from your _mouth_.
入;enter;This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to **enter** someplace. Since the  "in" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(69): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.;2) [[vgambit](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit)] 26-12-2008(36): Gordon Freeman **enters** the Black Mesa corporation's headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written).
作;make;Person . . . saw.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-2-2007(152): _Mr T._ 's favorite magazine is **Make**. He loves to **make** things. But he's a purist: he only uses _saws_ , no power tools.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 9-4-2007(70): When the A-Team crash lands on a deserted island, _Mr. T_ salvages a _saw_ from the wreckage and says, "I don't know about y'all foos, but I'm gonna **make** a raft.".
月;month;This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical "man in the moon." (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one **month** , of course, is one cycle of the moon.;1) [[cerulean](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean)] 19-5-2008(157): A **month** is longer than a day.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 21-3-2007(60): Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air "mooning" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of **month** , considering that **month** s were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning "ass" part of it connects well to Hesig's seemingly unconnected "flesh" or "part of the body" meaning (when used in primitive form).
書;write;The sage talks rapidly with his _tongue wagging in his mouth_ , while the _brush_ of the scribe runs apace to **write** down the master 'swords.;1) [[jinka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinka)] 27-4-2006(213): Make sure you practice **writing** kanji with a _brush_ every _day_ before the _sun_ goes down.;2) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 28-10-2007(36): The calligrapher had a peculiar habit: when using her _brush_ to **write** , she would stick out her _tongue_ , just slightly.
学;study;The _child_ in the little red _schoolhouse_ is there for one reason only: to **study**. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that **study** is one thing and _learning_ quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for _learning  _(Frame 616) has nothing to do with the _schoolhouse_.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 12-1-2007(78): In the _school house_ there are _kids_ always **studying**. (BTW, atomiton, this is NOT 字 ).;2) [[gwadonna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gwadonna)] 9-8-2008(51): Children in schoolhouses are there to **study** , nothing else!!!
合;fit;The kanji for **fit** reads literally, top to bottom, as a _meeting_ of _mouths_  \- which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't **fit**  with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose _mouths_ didn't **fit**.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(159): I wouldn't mind a _meeting_ of _mouths_ with her, she's really **fit** !;2) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 13-7-2007(102): He had such a big _mouth_ that he could easily **fit** _one_ whole _umbrella_ in it.
山;mountain;Note the clearer outline of a triangular **mountain** here.;1) [[the40pancakes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the40pancakes)] 14-4-2009(108): YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(67): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a **mountain** often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the **mountain** (see FRAME 775 for an example).
後;behind;Line . . . cocoon . . . walking legs.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 16-12-2006(228): Column of walking legs (caterpillar) getting into a cocoon, about to leave its past self **behind**.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 30-5-2007(75): **after** a grub _goes_ through the _cocoon_ stage, it leaves its _walking legs_ **behind** for a life of flight.
目;eye;Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an **eye**.;1) [[d3kuma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/d3kuma)] 13-7-2009(223): 目 _ 目 .;2) [[kylemanning](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kylemanning)] 22-11-2007(92): There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your **eye**. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color.
持;hold;Fingers . . . Buddhist temple.;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 19-8-2007(183): At the BUDDHIST TEMPLE you'll see wonderous things, such as the priest that can **HOLD** himself upside down with just a FINGER.;2) [[Tweenk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tweenk)] 10-4-2007(88): In Kyaiktiyo, there is rocking stone which sits on the edge of a cliff, and there is a _Buddhist temple_ built on the top of it. You can rock the stone by pushing it with your _finger_ , but it still **holds** in place. It's true, see here: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyaiktiyo>.
居;reside;_Flag_ . . . _old_. Do not confuse with _dwell_ (Frame 1027).;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 23-8-2007(178): A humongous _American flag_ in Florida marks the place where all the _old_ people **reside**.;2) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 16-9-2007(131): It is an _old_ tradition that people plant a _flag_ on places where decide to **reside** , this tradition still goes on: Antarctica, the moon: flags all over the place! cf. [set](../v4/1064.html) (#1064 据).
無;nothingness;This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: **nothingness**. Make use of the oaken _tub_ from the previous frame, and add to that the _oven fire_ at the bottom.;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 17-9-2007(278): When I enter the _wooden tub_ heated by _flames_ in the onsen, I can let all my worries slip away and be submerged into **nothingness**.;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 30-12-2006(40): In a hot tub you can relax and have your stress vanish into **nothingness**.
様;Esq.;The abbreviation **Esq.** will help associate this character with the honorific form of address to which it belongs. Its elements are: _tree_ . . . _sheep_ . . . _grains of rice_. Note that the final vertical stroke in the element for _sheep_ is extended to form the first stroke for _grains of rice_.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 6-4-2007(321): Here we have the requirements to be counted among the ranks of the noble **Esq.** You must posses a _forested_ estate, herds of _sheep_ , and granary full of _grains of rice_.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 5-9-2007(165): This is **-Sama** , a generic high term of respect for someone in an unusual profession. If you met a person that created a _wooden_ _sheep_ that was squeezing a single _grain of rice_ out of its ass, you'd definitely call that person **-sama**. Because that is impressive.
意;idea;Sound . . . heart.;1) [[onsen_monkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey)] 4-10-2006(325): When you get a good **IDEA** you get excited and you can hear the SOUND of your HEART, it's pounding so hard.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 11-10-2005(58): Picture someone who's just had a great **idea** , but in place of a blinking light bulb over their head, you see a _heart_ thumping with great _noise_. Imagine the greater the **idea** , the louder the _sound_ of the beating _heart_.
地;ground;_Soil_ and a _scorpion_ (an  "earth animal"). This is, of course, the full character from which the primitive for **ground** derives.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(161): Picture the **ground** as an extent of _soil_ where _scorpions_ are buried like land mines. Imagine a sign post saying 'no trespassing, _scorpion_ mines' if that helps, and how it is dangerous to walk there.;2) [[bigspenderJ](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigspenderJ)] 7-2-2007(77): The soil is littered with scorpions everywhere and no ones dares put their foot on the **ground**.
御;honorable;Line . . . wholesale.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 9-6-2007(207): An **honorable** man will not try to cut in front of the _line_ at the _wholesale_ stamp store. (Imagine just how much honor it takes facing those long lines at the post office!).;2) [[ergerg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg)] 5-5-2007(68): In front of the COLUMNS of the Capitol, the **HONORABLE** congressmen can be bought WHOLESALE.
屋;roof;_Flag_ . . . _climax_. Note that this kanji has no relation to the drawing of a  "roof" used in the primitive for _house_.;1) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 27-7-2007(219): Flag at the climax (highest point) of a castle **roof**.;2) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 10-4-2007(113): A couple climaxing on the **roof** , draped in the American flag. The neighbors are mortified and call the landlady…
度;degrees;This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: _caverns_ . . . _crotch_.;1) [[jimsublimeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman)] 4-12-2007(225): The _cavern refugees_ are so poor that they can't afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their _crotches_ inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in **degrees** from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs…;2) [[jameserb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb)] 3-5-2008(64): The cave is twenty **degrees** cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.
同;same;The primitives in this kanji show us _one_ and _mouth_ under a _hood_. Let us take the key word to connote the **sameness** that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the **same** habits, including the "habit" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's _cowl_ , drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a _mouth_. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of _one mouth_ under a _hood_ as the kanji for the **sameness** of monastic life.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(215): Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the **same** , you can just see ONE MOUTH and very little else.;2) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 5-9-2007(84): Imagine monks wandering around the monastery. Covered in their _hoods_ and chanting as if with _one mouth_ they all look the **same** !
不;negative;You may play with the primitives of this kanji as you wish ( _ceiling_ . . . _person_ . . . _a drop of_ ), _but_ you will probably find that its simplicity, and its frequency, make it easy to remember just as it is.;1) [[laner36](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36)] 24-9-2007(194): [Smithsonian] Scene: _Mr. T_ hanging from the _ceiling_ being tortured. He is asked if he is going to talk. Spitting (a _drop_ of saliva) in the torturer's face, he says "Negative".;2) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 20-8-2007(45): _One below_ zero is a **negative** number.
実;reality;House . . . bonsai.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 27-12-2006(239): Bonsais are grown in a house, away from the harsh **reality** of the real world where they wouldn't survive.;2) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 12-12-2007(104): On this rather boring 'big brother' type **reality** show, they have locked up _bonsai_ inside a _house_ and everyone is watching them on TV 24x7. The viewers have to vote on which bonsai shall remain in the house and which one has to leave.
話;tale;That the _words_ of the _tongue_ should come to mean a **tale** is clear from the etymology: a **_tale_** is something  "talked," not something read from a book.;1) [[dicedice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice)] 22-7-2007(178): **Tale** s are always spoken, not written, and because of this, _words_ fly out of your _tongue_ , rather than your pen.;2) [[Rivvie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie)] 28-1-2008(55): **Tale** s are _spoken words_ , passed on from person to person, eventually being spoken by a _thousand mouths_.
身;somebody;The key word **somebody** was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the _nose_ (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for _oneself_ ). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of **somebody** with a prominent paunch.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 8-12-2006(230): **Somebody** was just looking for you. He had a long _nose_ that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. (greenapple,16-3-2006) The way to remember that this is some _body_ rather than [someone](../v4/1256.html) (#1256 者) is that the story is full of _body_ descriptions.;2) [[greenapple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple)] 16-3-2006(56): **Somebody** was just looking for you. He had a long nose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face.
所;place;Door . . . ax.;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 11-9-2007(149): You outsiders better learn your **place**! An _axe_ stuck in the _door_ when you get home is a pretty good indicator that this might not be the best **place** for you.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 23-7-2007(94): A **place** for everything and everything in its **place**. To the right of the _door_ is the standard **place** for the _axe_.
先;before;Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a _cow_ with _human legs_ , as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a _cow_ -suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing **before** , rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the "butt" of everyone's laughter.;1) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 20-10-2007(232): I've never seen a _cow_ with _human legs_ **before**!;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 9-6-2008(158): Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji. "BEFORE you stick it in a COW and SPREAD the legs (the bottom stroke of this cow looks like two legs) make sure she has HUMAN LEGS"————-sorry, I'll remove if I get enough reports, but will keep if I get more stars.
力;power;With a little imagination, one can see a muscle in this simple, two-stroke character meaning **power**.;1) [[lankydan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan)] 23-8-2007(140): I always refer to the **power** of the _KATAKANA "KA"_.;2) [[stshores24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24)] 10-7-2008(39): I have a very **power** ful _muscle カ_ in my driveway!
五;five;As with _four_ , we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for **five**.;1) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 11-4-2008(236): 三 + two vertical lines = 5.;2) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 25-2-2006(36): This Kanji looks like a "3" Kanji with two added vertical lines. 3+2= 5.
明;bright;Among nature's **bright** lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the _sun_ to rule over the day and the _moon_ to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the _sun_ , the **bright** insight of the clear thinker, and the _moon_ , the **bright** intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13).;1) [[ablindmouse](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ablindmouse)] 28-8-2007(330): The sun makes the moon **bright**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(58): The sun and the moon are **bright** est objects in the day and night, respectively.
代;substitute;Person . . . arrow.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 18-10-2005(178): " _Mister T_ **substitute** s an _arrow_ for a toothpick" – The keyword meaning is to replace something with something else, to act for another, to represent. It's best to stick to the first meaning, because the last two are very close to "mediator" which will come in frame 1761. The idea here is that the _arrow_ is not a toothpick, neither it is changed into one, but it can **substitute** for one.;2) [[bkvogel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bkvogel)] 31-7-2008(60): Mr. T shot the **substitute** teacher with an arrow.
然;sort of thing;The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality, hence we refer to it as " **sort of thing**. " Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an _oven flame_ with the _flesh_ of a _chihuahua_ being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a  "hot- diggity, dog-diggity" **sort of thing**.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 11-10-2007(322): _Flesh_ of a _dog_ over a cooking fire = "hotdog". There are all **sorts of things** in _hot dogs_. Believe me, you don't want to know what **sort of things** . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr's. Thanks!).;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 9-9-2006(98): There are all **sorts of things** in _hot dogs_. (I use _hot dog_ for this primitive ( _meat_ of a _dog_ over a _cooking fire_ ). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).
通;traffic;_Chop-seal_ . . . _utilize_ . . . _road_. By combining the first two primitives into a single image, you will be able to use that image in a few instances later, one of which comes immediately.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 13-2-2008(328): I bounce down the _road_ on my _pogo stick_ , easily getting through the dense **traffic**. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a _chop-seal_ is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could _utilize_ it as a _pogo stick_ ). [Edit: _pogo stick_ also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 7-7-2006(45): Building on gorgon's story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the **traffic**. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge _chopseal_ that they _utilize_ to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the _road_.
水;water;This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of **water**  \- not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for **water**. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a _walking stick_ being dropped vertically into the **water** , sending _droplets_ out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 8-11-2007(67): The kanji for **water** is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes, constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig's story doesn't do this).;2) [[CandyCane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CandyCane)] 5-10-2008(54): For those having issues with this* "A 7K foot pool of **water** " Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.
聞;hear;_Gates_ . . . _ear_. Compare the story you invented for the kanji meaning _listen_ (Frame 890).;1) [[laxxy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy)] 3-10-2006(195): Press your ear to the gates and see if you can **hear** what is going on inside.;2) [[ambrokusa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambrokusa)] 2-4-2007(50): To distinguish from listen, you **hear** someone at the door (gate).
長;long;In line with the story of the preceding frame, the _hair_ that needs the _hairpin_ is **long**.;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 7-10-2007(152): The Geisha with **long** _hair_ uses an ornate lacquered _hairpin_ to bundle it all up.;2) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 22-6-2008(74): The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here's my story: The girl's hair was so **long** that she had to use _staples_ instead of _hairpins_. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.
少;few;First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the _drop_ at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny _drop_ indicate a further belittling of what is already _little_ \- thus making it a **few** of something _little_.;1) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 6-2-2008(129): Only a **few** people can make an ugly face like that.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 3-8-2007(60): **Few** usually refers to three. To emphasize three, we underline the three drops in little.
第;No.;The key word **No.** is the abbreviation for  "number." Its elements: _bamboo_ . . . _dollar sign_.;1) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 5-3-2007(214): The **No.** 1 currency in the world is the _dollar_. But, the Asian nations are fast catching up and may in reality have already surpassed it. So, let the _bamboo_ represent the **No.** 2 currencies (the yen, etc.). The reverse order ( _bamboo_ on top and the _dollar_ on the bottom) is really a look at the future.;2) [[WithLoveFromExIA](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA)] 10-1-2009(101): The **No.** 1 currency may at one time have been the dollar, but since the economic slowdown the _weak dollar_ has been overtaken by currencies from _bamboo_ growing countries. (Thanks to Johnnyltn for the idea.) Using the alternate writing of the dollar primitive as weak dollar.
感;emotion;Mouths . . . marching . . . heart.;1) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 15-2-2008(283): **Emotion** is a _march of mouths_ inside your _heart_ telling you what to feel.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 17-7-2008(130): Strong **EMOTION** S don't stay hidden. They march right out of one's _heart_ (below) and out _one_ 's _mouth_ (shouted, snarled, or gently whispered - depending on exactly what kind of **emotion** it is!).
世;generation;We generally consider one **generation** as a period of thirty (or _ten_ plus _ten_ plus _ten_ ) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three _tens_. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as  "addition" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: _ten_ "plus" _ten_ "plus" _ten_ = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(112): 3 tens = **generation**.;2) [[CarlKenner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner)] 5-7-2007(71): They **SAY** a **generation** is _ten_ + _ten_ + _ten_ years, with the big first _ten_ providing a _grounding_ , and the next _ten_ providing a little more _grounding_ for the final _ten_. But I wish the next **generation** didn't always **SAY** " **yo!** ". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo).
空;empty;Hole . . . craft.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 4-6-2006(132): The _craft_ of creating a _black hole_ is in creating an **emptiness** which can attract things.;2) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 7-11-2007(76): Hole- craft is the way of making **empty** spaces, like the sky.
四;four;This character is composed of two primitive elements, _mouth_ and _human legs_ , both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the "story" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top- to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast.;1) [[tomb771](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomb771)] 9-2-2007(115): **FOUR** year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 21-3-2007(42): I imagine a giant devouring a human in **four** bites. First the giant bites off the person's head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the **four** th bite falling in there?
理;logic;We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of **logic** we are given is something like a central _jewel_ in a _computer_ , like the _jewels_ in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining _jewel_ , a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all- knowing **logic**.;1) [[Birdsong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong)] 26-4-2007(341): The king of **LOGIC** is the computer.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 16-7-2006(33): Computers are ruled by **logic** (it is the king of computers).
田;rice field;Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a **rice field** divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.;1) [[Chisaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chisaku)] 30-6-2007(114): A **rice field** divided into four parts.;2) [[Kosmo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kosmo)] 17-5-2008(41): _Ten_ people use their _mouths_ to eat the yield of the **rice fields**.
主;lord;A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was **lord** of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or _drop_ ) of a _king_ in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to  "read off" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the _drop_ down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-10-2007(196): A **lord** is a little _drop_ down from _King_ in hierarchy.;2) [[Spoonz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz)] 15-2-2009(79): A **lord** only has a drop of the king's power.
名;name;Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the **name** he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive **naming** custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: _evening_ . . . _mouth_. At _evening_ time, a _mouth_ pronounces the **name** that will accompany one throughout life.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(165): In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your **name** so that people can recognise you.;2) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(81): In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my **name**.
口;mouth;Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for **mouth** is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.;1) [[currynrice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/currynrice)] 30-6-2007(110): Looks like a huge open **mouth**.;2) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 8-11-2008(21): When you sneeze, your **MOUTH** forms a square, and you make a noise that sounds like (KUCHI).
面;mask;Imagine a **mask** over your head with _eyes_ peeping out from all over the head, a _hundred_ in all (the element for _eye_ displacing the fifth stroke of that for _hundred_ ).;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 4-10-2007(147): When Jim Carrey puts on **The **Mask**** , he can make it seem like he has _100 eyes_ popping out of his head.;2) [[phauna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna)] 27-2-2008(106): If you're wearing a **mask** , a _hundred_ _eyes_ can look at you but none of them will know who you are.
場;location;Soil . . . piggy bank.;1) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 30-5-2007(259): You're looking for a good **location** to bury your _piggy bank_ savings. It has to be in some soft _soil_ that's easy to dig up, well hidden, and easy to rememger like this kanji.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 27-1-2008(86): Don't confuse with [place](../v4/1127.html) (#1127 所). Think of **location** not as a single fixed spot, but as the act of locating. You've buried your _piggy bank_ in the _dirt_ in your backyard, but you can't remember where. You frantically dig everywhere in a process of **location** to find your piggy bank.
顔;face;Lad . . . head.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 12-7-2007(168): The _lad_ jumps off the cliff, breaks his _head_ , and smashes his **face**.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 10-4-2008(54): When I was a _lad_ , a pretty **face** was all it took for someone to get in my _head_ , and I'd fill _pages_ of lovelorn letters to them.
君;old boy;The somewhat highbrow British term of address is chosen hereto represent the kanji for a form of address used towards one's juniors. It is composed of: _mop_ . . . _mouth_.;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 9-3-2011(224): There's a tendency in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. "Well **old boy** ," a senpai might say, "If you did as much work with the _mop_ as you do with your _mouth,_ you would have been done an hour ago".;2) [[stefanot](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot)] 22-1-2007(69): The Beatles, english **old boy** s, had hairs like _mop_ and a good singing _mouth_.
成;turn into;Let the phrase " **turn into** " suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the _parade_ marching down main street **turns into** a _dagger_ -throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change.;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 19-2-2008(248): It only takes a single stroke of a _dagger_ for a _parade_ to **TURN INTO** a bloodbath.;2) [[usis35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35)] 4-11-2007(26): The gay parade suddenly TURNED INTO a DAGGER throwing fight.
白;white;The color **white** is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single _drop_ of _sun_ spells **white**.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(130): A **white** ray is a drop of sun.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 29-10-2007(61): Even a small drop (') of the sun ( 日 ) would make you see nothing but **white**.
考;consider;_Old man_ . . . _slingshot_. Remember: you already have kanji for _discriminating_ (Frame 521), _deliberation_ (Frame 692), and _think_ (Frame 651).;1) [[kyldyyr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyldyyr)] 17-11-2005(224): Before shooting an _old man_ with a _slingshot_ , one shold carefully **consider** the possible consequences.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 14-3-2007(82): Even though he had the _old man_ Mr. Wilson within the sights of his _slingshot_ , Dennis the Menace **considered** what he was doing and stopped.
道;road-way;The key word carries both the sense of a **road** for transit and a **way** or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the _neck_ of a _road_. Think of a crowded **road-way** where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a  "bottle _neck_. ";1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 5-2-2008(198): When we go out on the **ROAD-WAY** , we often risk our own _necks_ (that's why I take the train! ).;2) [[whistler11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11)] 19-12-2005(39): Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel's _neck_ over a dusty _road_. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her _neck_ be ground into the _road_ , spilling it's precious contents into the dust?
正;correct;"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step," says the Chinese proverb. Here we see _one footprint_ , complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made **correctly** , the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in **correcting** their students, and parents in **correcting** their children.;1) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 19-10-2007(223): If you do it **correct** on the _first_ attempt you can _stop_.;2) [[tom2000](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tom2000)] 4-8-2009(43): My (Japanese) wife tells me that Japanese people use this kanji to tally up numbers (instead of 4 vertical lines and a diagonal across). I remember this one by writing the kanji while counting out the strokes to myself and saying this is the **correct** way to tally numbers.
郎;son;Halo . . . city walls.;1) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 11-2-2007(262): The _daughter_ is a good girl that grows up to be a woman. The **son** is a _good_ boy that grows up to defend the _city walls_.;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 1-1-2007(19): Just like a daughter ( 娘 ) is good woman, **son** is good too, and stays safely inside city walls so as not to give his parents reason to worry.
当;hit;Little . . . broom.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 9-4-2007(249): Some mothers use a _small broom_ to **hit** their children when they misbehave.;2) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 25-2-2007(53): [hit, right, appropriate, himself] If you're old enough, this is a pictograph of an Atari joystick (which, BTW, got its name from this word/kanji). You can also think of how an Atari joystick is like a _small_ _broom_ with which you can **hit** and sweep off the enemies from the screen…
男;man;_Rice fields_ . . . _power_. This character is the gender-specific **man** , not the generic human _person_ of frame 951.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(212): Male is seen here as muscles working in the field, in other words working in the rice fields is the work of the male who are usually stronger. This is more or less the meaning of the original Chinese character.;2) [[Callooh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Callooh)] 3-9-2007(107): When it comes to choosing a **MAN** , I prefer _brains_ over _muscles_.
外;outside;On the left, the primitive for _evening_ , and on the right, that for the _magic wand_. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your _magic wand_ out into the _evening_ air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, _evening_ and _magic wand_ takes you naturally **outside**.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 7-7-2008(134): A young magician likes to practice **outside** in the _evening_ with his _magic wand_ (as opposed to the old magician who wakes _early_ to practice with his _wand_ in [eminent](../v4/51.html) (#51 卓)).;2) [[jondesousa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jondesousa)] 19-6-2006(77): **Outside** in the dark of evening, only a magic wand can help you.
国;country;Jewels . . . pent in.;1) [[Howdoken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken)] 12-1-2008(127): In my **country** (England) the crown _jewels_ are kept _pent-in_ in the Tower of London. Which happens to be where enemies of the state were once also _pent- in_ (probably for trying to steal those _jewels_ ).;2) [[genbaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku)] 11-1-2008(95): Just think of Japan, a **country** which is like a jewel but historically very enclosed.
会;meeting;_Meeting_ . . . _wall_. This is the full character for **meeting** , from which the abbreviated primitive that we met back in lesson 12 gets its name.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(194): At the local company they have a very gory way of getting rid of incompetent personnel : they arrange a business **meeting** in a very special room where the walls are … **meeting**. Not surprisingly the boss is never present at these **meeting** s, he's the one who pushes the button that sets the walls in motion.;2) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 5-11-2007(102): The only thing created in most **meeting** s is a lot of hot air. Imagine a _cloud of it rising_ to the _roof_.
取;take;Ear . . . crotch.;1) [[Rakushun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun)] 17-5-2007(257): You put your ear next to a womans crotch…and somehow, from it, you hear the words "Take me….".;2) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 1-5-2009(136): Fuaburisu's with a twist: You know that classic trick where someone pretends to **take** something out of an someone else's _ear_ (such as a coin). Instead of a cigarette or a pen he pulls the person’s _crotch_ out of their ear. Very painful!
新;new;Red pepper . . . ax.;1) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 27-2-2006(207): (I don't like the 'red pepper plant' primative so I just go for _standing atop a tree_ ). Here we have the woodcutter _standing atop a tree_ waving his brand **new** _axe_. "Look what I got for christmas, yippee!".;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 16-10-2005(66): Axe-man grows a patch of _red pepper plants_ in his back garden. He rubs _red peppers_ on the edge of his _axes_ , and this seems to keep them sharp like brand **new**.
風;wind;_Windy_ . . . _drops of_ . . . _insects_. Hint: think of the last two primitives as representing a swarm of _gnats_ , those tiny _drops of_ pesky _insects_.;1) [[Ceryn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn)] 16-4-2008(137): They say that when an INSECT flaps its wings even the single DROP of **WIND** that it creates is sometimes enough to create a hurricane on the other side of the Earth.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 29-1-2008(82): The **WIND** usually carries things around in it - _drops_ of rain or snow, and lots of _insects_.
神;gods;Altar . . . monkey.;1) [[Floatingweed5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5)] 10-9-2007(108): The **Gods** are gathered around debating Zeus' latest purchase for Mount Olympus. A huge and extremely kitsch gilded altar in the shape of giant "speak no evil" monkey. Hera decides she will never let him go shopping alone again .;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 30-12-2006(107): Hinduism has many **gods** , not just one God. One of the most famous of these **gods** is Hanuman the _monkey_. Many _altars_ are dedicated to him.
動;move;Heavy . . . muscle.;1) [[Copycatken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken)] 4-7-2006(132): Even though the furniture is _heavy_ , it'll be easy to **move** with all the _muscles_ that he has.;2) [[kumakuma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma)] 6-7-2008(91): His MUSCLES are so HEAVY, he barely can **move** …thats ironic.
部;section;Muzzle . . . city walls.;1) [[Copycatken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken)] 28-6-2006(155): Within the _city walls_ , this **section** of town was so noisy that we had to _muzzle_ them up.;2) [[stehr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr)] 22-11-2007(34): " **Section** 8 housing" is a way to _muzzle_ the impoverished people who are unable to pay rent but want to live inside the _city walls_.
向;yonder;Something referred to as "over **yonder** " is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee _drop_ in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a _drop_. Then we find a sort of transparent _helmet_ with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent _mouth_ under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its _mouth_ open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over **yonder** with its fuel tank on empty.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 5-9-2007(142): Look over **yonder** ! That tiny _dot_ is robin _hood_ at the _mouth_ of his secret cave !;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 22-3-2008(73): There was an old woman named Wanda,// Who wanted to make herself blonder.// She covered her _くち_ // With a _glass hood_ from Gucci// And _drop_ ped some hair dye on from **yonder**.
夜;night;First of all, be sure not to confuse the connotations of **night** with those of _evening_ (Frame 114) and _nightbreak_ (Frame 30). Its elements: _top hat_ . . . _person_ . . . _walking legs_ . . . _drop_.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 25-4-2007(216): Actually, the lower-right primitive isn't quite "walking legs." It's a little more like "evening" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for **night** as: _evening_ plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the _top hat_ which my special _person_ is wearing out on the town…;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 18-10-2005(86): Here we have _Mister T_ sleepwalking, wearing a _top hat_ as if he was the ambassador of the **night** , walking, and walking and walking on his tired _walking legs_ , until he _drops_ (back into his bed).
内;inside;_Person_ . . . _belt_. Note that we cannot use the primitive meaning of _hood_ here because the _person_ runs THROUGH the element, not under it.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 11-7-2008(135): _Mr. T_ 's new _belt_ is huge! When he's **inside** it, his feet no longer touch the ground!;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 2-9-2008(118): A seat _belt_ keeps a _person_ **inside** the vehicle.
青;blue;Grow up . . . moon.;1) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 6-2-2008(147): "Once in a **blue** _moon_ " refers to a rare event. But originally "blue moon" refers to a full moon, in other words a fully _grown-up_ moon. Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we're talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 4-3-2007(104): The last time I saw a **blue** _moon_ was in my **youth** when I was _growing up_.
相;inter-;The prefix **inter-** stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: _tree_ . . . _eye_. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own _eye_ before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for **inter-** human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!;1) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 25-3-2008(225): The prime minister is having **inter-** course behind that _tree_! All you can see are his _eyes_ poking out from the righthand-side of the _tree_.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 8-4-2008(94): ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. "Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb _trees_ to _eye_ each other's aspects and **inter-** act for their mutual benefit. Those who did this best became government _ministers_ , with the top person (perhaps the one with the longest neck ( 首 , [neck](../v4/70.html) (#70 首)) becoming the prime _minister_ [「首相](midori://search?text=「首相) (しゅしょう)".
体;body;Person . . . book.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 28-10-2005(133): _Mister T_ works out his **body** (body-building), using two piles of _books_ (i.e. an exercise that can be done at home with two chairs, similar to push- ups but working mostly the shoulders, trapezius and triceps).;2) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 14-1-2008(53): Mr. T works out his **body** then rips a book apart to test is **body**. His favorite to destroy is Dianetics.
眼;eyeball;Eye . . . silver.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 1-3-2007(156): T-1000. <http://clicknothing.typepad.com/Images_Posts_2006/T1000.jpg>.;2) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 17-9-2006(102): **_Eye_ balls** made of _silver_. That's what they use to play pachinko with, isn't it?
木;tree;Here we see a pictograph of a **tree** , showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for _water_ (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.;1) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 28-6-2008(137): If you need a story for a **tree** , then you need to be hit by one.;2) [[beth266](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/beth266)] 2-8-2009(18): Pictograph of a **tree**.
味;flavor;When a tree has _not yet_ finished growing, it produces fruit with a full **flavor**. When the official taster (the professional _mouth_ to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently _not yet_ grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of **flavor** hidden in this character.;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 17-8-2007(251): My _mouth_ has _not yet_ swallowed the food because the **flavor** is so delicious that I keep chewing it.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 6-4-2008(134): To enjoy a food's **FLAVOR** , it must be in one's MOUTH but NOT YET swallowed.
僕;me;This key word is yet another synonym for "I," somewhat more familiar in tone. As a rule, it is a word that boys and men use to refer to themselves. Its elements: _person_ . . . _husbands_ . . . _in a row upside down_.;1) [[snallygaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster)] 13-5-2008(145): Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig **me** thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it's the kanji for "boku." Males usually use either "boku" or "ore" (instead of "watashi") to refer themselves. "Boku" is slightly boyish and soft, "ore" is rough & tough. Mr. T would definitely use "ore" – but when he's one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to "boku" when he pleads "come on baby, it's **ME**!".;2) [[johnskb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb)] 21-5-2006(112): Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s **ME** , Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.
多;many;" **Many** _moons_ ago, " begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying "Once upon a time" and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two _moons_  (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time.;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 13-2-2008(105): _Two evenings_ too **many**!;2) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 17-3-2006(46): This reminds me of a childish pseudo-confucion rhyme: "He who eats **many** prunes sits on toilet **many** _moons_ ".
声;voice;The _samurai_ at the top is familiar enough. The combination beneath, which looks like a _flag_ with a line running through it, is not. Try to devise some way to take note of it, and pay attention to the writing.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 17-7-2007(256): When an enemy's _flag_ is raised, a true _samurai_ can _split_ it in half with just his **voice**.;2) [[bananarama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bananarama)] 2-3-2008(65): Having lost his **voice** , the samurai comunicated to his troops with a striped flag.
現;present;Do not think of a "gift" here, but of the **present** moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a _ball_ in which we see the **present**  \- obviously a crystal _ball_ that enables us to _see_ things going on at the **present** in faraway places.;1) [[mimiko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mimiko)] 20-8-2007(176): _The KING_ … can _SEE_ clearly the **PRESENT** state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).;2) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 4-1-2008(67): Hey, I want my money back! This crystal _ball_ is out of order, I can _see_ the **present** instead of the future!
平;even;This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of **even**. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 15-10-2006(106): There's an **even** covering of _water lilies_ on the pond at 金閣寺 （きんかくじ） the Golden Pavilion in Kyoto.;2) [[stshores24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24)] 7-9-2008(50): **Even** if Heisig showed me in person, I still wouldn't believe that this is a _water lily_. I don't get it.
葉;leaf;Three elements are given here: _flower_ . . . _generation_ . . . _tree_. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the **leaf** that feeds the _flowers_ on a _tree_. The element for _generation_ interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a _tree_ from one _generation_ to the next is like its  "turning over a new **leaf**. ";1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 13-7-2007(246): On top of the **leaves** a _flower_ appears, promising new _generations_ for the old _tree_ below.;2) [[shimouma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma)] 29-3-2008(120): The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.
全;whole;**Wholeness** suggests physical and spiritual health,  "having your act together." The kanji-image for **wholeness** depicts being  " _king_ under your own _umbrella_ ," that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word **whole**?;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 18-10-2007(168): The fat _king_ hogs the **whole** space under his _umbrella_. (tweaked version of radical tyro's story. "fat" makes a more vivid image for me.).;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 20-12-2005(121): The _king_ takes up the **whole** space under his _umbrella_.
足;leg;_Mouth_ . . . _mending_. Note that the last stroke of _mouth_ and the first of _mending_ overlap.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 2-6-2007(218): Captain Ahab lost his **leg** to the great white whale's _mouth_ and had to _mend_ it with a peg **leg**.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 18-1-2008(86): I'll use my _mouth_ to _mend_ your **leg** , I'll kiss it all better :).
切;cut;To the right we see the _dagger_ and next to it the number _seven_ whose primitive meaning we decided would be _diced_ (Frame 7). It is hard to think of **cutting** anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a _dagger_ lying on the mantelpiece and starts _dicing_ up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets....;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(260): The seven samurai used their swords to **cut** their opponents.;2) [[phauna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna)] 6-1-2008(83): Seven swords **cut** better than one.
金;gold;If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of **gold** bullion with an _umbrella_ overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the _scepters_ of the kingdom, _drop_ by _drop_ , and shaping them into bars.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-10-2007(173): The fat _king_ taking up the _whole_ space under the _umbrella_ actually isn't fat - he just has two big **gold** bars hidden under his clothes.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 31-1-2008(39): Under the _umbrella's_ shade, the king sang, " _Drop_ it to the left, _drop_ it to the right, give me all the **GOLD** in sight!".
近;near;_Ax_ . . . _road_. Be careful not to confuse with _draw near_ (Frame 204) or _bystander_ (Frame 1090).;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 30-12-2006(261): The end is **near**. The _axe_ -murderer is waiting for you on the _road_ …;2) [[zenkun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zenkun)] 13-3-2006(98): An absurd image, but working for me: two points A and B are separated by a long _road_. To make A and B **near** , take an _ax_ , cut a big chunk of road, and the work is done.
色;color;Bound up . . . mosaic.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 17-11-2006(213): _Bound up_ in the _Rubik's cube_ are the 6 different **colours**.;2) [[Haych](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych)] 22-11-2008(54): Ever look closely at _mosaic_ s? They contain a bunch of images _bound up_ into a larger one. It seems amazing until you realize that the only quality of the smaller images that really matters is their **colour**.
発;discharge;This key word refers to the **discharging** of guns, trains, people, and even words. The elements: _teepee_ . . . _two_ . . . _human legs_. Contrast the writing with frame 63.;1) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 13-4-2008(207): I spent some time in her TEEPEE…just the TWO of us…but I looked between her HUMAN LEGS and I saw a nasty **DISCHARGE** …so I made my 出発 rather hastily.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 25-4-2008(101): _Two pairs of human legs_ poking out of a _teepee_ : you know there'll be a **discharge** soon, be it sexual, violent (husband returns home with a weapon), or dishonourable (soldier caught molesting a native), or perhaps all of the above.
母;mama;Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for _woman_ in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a **mama**. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.;1) [[mr_hans_moleman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mr_hans_moleman)] 5-7-2007(76): The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds.;2) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 14-10-2007(34): This **mama** had twins, one _mouth_ for each _nipple_.
高;tall;Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the _mouth_ under the extraterrestrial's glass _hood_ , and then the _mouth_ under the _top hat_ of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much **taller** than everyone else.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 30-11-2007(149): Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and _top hat_ , trying to look **TALL**. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 13-6-2008(82): Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a **TALL** hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).
以;by means of;Picture a _person_ dragging a _plow_ behind, and the _drop of_ sweat which falls from his brow as he does his work. Think of him (or her, for that matter) making a living  " **by means of** the sweat of their brows. ";1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 3-11-2005(188): A man earns his living **by means of** the plow. I imagine a sweating man dragging a bronze-age "ard" behind him as he plows his field himself, too poor to afford an ox.;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 23-1-2008(42): Mr T now makes a living **by means of** a plow/hoe and the sweat he puts into it.
用;utilize;_Meat_ . . . _walking stick_. Be sure to keep this key word distinct from that for _use_ (Frame 1065). The stroke order is exactly as you would expect it from the order of the primitive elements as given.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 7-5-2007(141): To tenderize _meat_ in an emergency wilderness situation, just **utilize** your _walking stick_!;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 20-12-2007(115): I'll confuse this with [use](../v4/990.html) (#990 使), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, "utilize" has an artificial, business-speak connotation, you only **utilize** "utilize" when you're trying to puff up what you're saying and sound important. So: "BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, **utilizing** the our latest _Flesh_ Grip(tm) technology!" I'm seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of _flesh_ , a short _shaft_ , and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it.
死;death;_Bones_ . . . _spoon_. Note how the first stroke is extended to the right, forming a sort of  "roof" overhead.;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 3-11-2005(252): Ok, this is where knowing some Eastern culture comes in handy! In Japanese society, when someone dies they creamate the body and pick out the remaining bones with special chopsticks. In this case, they're out of chopsticks so they decide to use (gasp!) a spoon instead.;2) [[pacersfan218](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pacersfan218)] 1-9-2007(108): Imagine the grim reaper (the bringer of **death** ), carrying a _spoon_ made of human _bones_ instead of a scythe.
八;eight;Just as the Arabic numeral "8" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for **eight** is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the  "lazy 8" is the mathematical symbol for "infinity," so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something "all-encompassing.";1) [[clemk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/clemk)] 18-6-2006(120): "Hachi" (eight) begins with the sound of the **katakana "ha"** , and it's approximately the same character.;2) [[Rose_Arteth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rose_Arteth)] 17-8-2007(65): The valcano hasn't erupted for 8 years.
得;gain;Column . . . nightbreak . . . glue.;1) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 21-1-2008(211): To **gain** more knowledge of what's goin on in the world I'm reading _column_ after _column_ of articles in the newspapers, and it takes so much time I'm _glued_ to it till _nightbreak_.;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 20-9-2008(106): Imagine fat people……they avoid _going_ outside to exercise and stay _glued_ to their TV set until _nightbreak_ ….so of course they **gain** weight.
頭;head;Here we meet at last the full kanji on which the primitive for **head** is based. The elements: _table_ . . . _head_.;1) [[blackstockc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc)] 17-2-2008(215): The **head** of the family sits at the **head** of the _table_.;2) [[cameron_en](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en)] 25-10-2008(87): _Mr. Bean_ has a funny **_head_**.
次;next;This key word connotes the " **next** in line " of a succession of people or things. Let there be a _lack_ of _ice_ on the hottest day of summer, and you stand impatiently in line waiting for the distributor to call out  " **Next**! ";1) [[g33kette](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/g33kette)] 4-3-2008(121): Is this store _lack_ ing _ice_? Let's try the **next** one, then.;2) [[Lozza](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lozza)] 18-7-2008(89): A rapper called "Ice" went for auditions but was told he lacked talent. **Next** …
天;heavens;This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the **Heavens**. (You may, of course, use the elements _ceiling_ and _St. Bernard_ instead.);1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-1-2006(123): If you think of the sky as a _ceiling_ above our heads, here you have the **heavens** as the _largest ceiling_ you could ever imagine. As Heisig pointed out, nothing comes above the _ceiling_ primitive thus the order of primitives is taken care of.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 26-10-2006(48): The _ceiling_ that all _large dogs_ aspire to go to is known as heaven. After all, _All Dogs Go to Heaven_.
夫;husband;The kanji for _a_ **husband** or  "head of the family" is based on the kanji for _large_ and an extra line near the top for the  "head." Recall the kanji for _heavens_  already learned back in frame 457, and be sure to keep your story for this kanji different.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 15-10-2006(233): Even though it is argued size is not important, I'm sure most women would like their **husband** to have a _big one_.;2) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 25-2-2007(72): Homer Simpson, as a primitive.
真;true;Here again we meet the composite element, _eye of the needle_ , which here combines with _tool_ to give us a measure of what is **true** and what is not.;1) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 2-10-2007(262): A compass is a _tool_ with a _needle_ on top that points to **true** north.;2) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 5-12-2007(159): _Ten_ _tools_ are all a **true** craftsman needs.
父;father;The kindness and hard work of the ideal **father** is seen in this abbreviation of the _taskmaster_ that leaves off his rod or whip (the first stroke) and replaces it with the sweat of the **father's** brow (the two _drops_ at the top).;1) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 2-2-2008(214): Luke, I am your **father**. Darth Vader (really surprised nobody put this one up before: 2 laserswords).;2) [[sleepyday](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday)] 26-10-2008(59): Not to confuse anyone, but I think if you put your mind to it, you can see the image of a **father** here. The first two strokes take on the form of his eye brows, and the third and fourth stroke make up the nose and mustache.
親;parent;Red pepper . . . see.;1) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 13-3-2007(321): I remember this one the way the Japanese do: a **parent** _standing_ on top of a _tree_ _watching_ what his or her kid is doing.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 14-12-2006(80): A wise **parent** lets their kids learn. A kid wants to try to eat the _red pepper plant_ , the wise **parent** says "Try it and _see_ for yourself".
帰;homecoming;_Spear_ . . . _broom_ . . . _apron_. The character for _lady_ (Frame 1234) shares the same right side as this character, which does not bode for a very happy **homecoming**.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 12-10-2007(227): A female warrior returns home from battle. Her husband takes away her _spear_ to symbolize the end of fighting and gives her a _broom_ and an _apron_. “Boy, this is some kind of **HOMECOMING** ,” thinks the veteran.

美;beauty;Try to think of what the Chinese were on to when they associated the idea of **beauty** with a _large sheep_.;1) [[Howdoken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken)] 4-1-2008(163): I guess this kanji proves it's not just the Welsh whose idea of **beauty** is a _large_ _sheep_.;2) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 25-7-2007(75): A _Sheep_ on top of a _dog_ is NOT a **beautiful** thing.

Once again, we glide over them until later.;1) [[Andre_Breton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Andre_Breton)] 5-12-2007(127): Indicating 6 parts of the human body: head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs.;2) [[Jeromin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin)] 22-12-2008(69): The Devil, always a gentleman, wears a top hat, but his goat legs, betray the Beast. 666 is his number.

(Real origin of this kanji). **Pull** and release to fire!
野;plains;This character refers to rustic life and rustic fields primarily, and from there gets derived meanings.

Beforehand we all worked out in the fields, in the **plains**.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 25-2-2007(70): The **plains** are a challenging place to get any work done.

The latter appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing _angel_ 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369). Story: The fully-grown _bamboo_ trees are **laugh** ing at the little _sapling_.
音;sound;The kanji for **sound** depicts something _standing_ in the air over a _tongue wagging in a mouth_ , much the same as a **sound** does for the briefest of moments before disappearing.;1) [[Aploosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aploosh)] 23-8-2007(201): If you were standing on the sun, believe me, you'd be making **sound**.;2) [[HMiettinen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HMiettinen)] 21-10-2007(75): The _tongue wagging in a mouth_ produces a very high-pitched **sound** , breaking a nearby _vase_.
表;surface;_Grow up_ . . . _rags_. This character represents the  "outside" of a garment, just as the kanji for _back_ (Frame 426) depicted the  "inside" or lining.;1) [[ergerg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg)] 17-7-2006(239): When I was GROWING UP, the **SURFACE** of my SCARF was always covered with snot from blowing my nose on it.;2) [[Green_Airplane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane)] 6-8-2008(97): As girls _grow up_ , something slowly **surfaces** from under their _scarf_.

歩;walk;_Footprints_ that follow one another a _few_ at a time indicate **walking**.;1) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 24-1-2006(188): When **walk** ing your pet, you must _stop_ a _few_ times along the way when nature calls.;2) [[Delina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Delina)] 28-2-2008(79): When you learn to **walk** , you take your _steps_ a _few_ at a time. Picture a clumsy but happy toddler who falls every _few_ _steps_ but keeps getting up to try again.
馬;horse;Let the extra vertical stroke in the _mane_ combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the **horse's** long neck. The only odd thing is the _tail feathers_ at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of _mane_ and the first of _tail feathers_ coincide should no longer surprise you.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 5-1-2007(124): Turkey with the drops at the top removed and tail feathers added (this matches stroke order and there are the tail feathers already, why not have the whole bird). If you take the two drops of 隹 as wings, then **horse** s are like turkeys, but have no wings and have more prominent tail "feathers". Both are actually supposed to be pictographs, though.;2) [[NeoGlitch](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch)] 18-1-2012(42): **FINALLY!! Geeeeeeeeeez!!!**.
形;shape;Two hands . . . shape.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 31-5-2007(147): Everyone in the kindergarten came up with fun and interesting **shape** s made out of _Play-Doh_ , except for the kid with the amputated arm.

Is that a universally understood gesture? [Careful: [mould](../v4/680.html) (#680 型) which has two hands and soil/clay].
太;plump;" **Plump** " is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample- bodied person falling into a sofa like a _large drop_ of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr- **plump**!;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 3-8-2007(152): A _large_ person with a big _drop_ of sweat dripping off of him because he is so **plump**.;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 27-2-2006(80): Fat("plump") men always have small penises…..the kanji is a combination of "large" with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs).
川;stream;We have taken the image of a river **stream** over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a **stream**.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 2-9-2007(86): So as not to confuse this with [river](../v4/146.html) (#146 河) think of **stream** ers falling down.;2) [[dogen2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2)] 17-3-2007(63): There are _three_ default I/O **Streams** in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.

See also [dilute](../v4/227.html) (#227 薄), [clan](../v4/1912.html) (#1912 藩), [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers **fall** ing through the sky – suddenly _each_ one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori _seaweed_ to carry them safely down.

食;eat;If _halo_ and _umbrella_ aren't enough, break the _halo_ down into _drop_ and _silver_ \- or  "silverware," an additional primitive.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 4-4-2007(173): That _umbrella_ looks _good_ enough to **eat**!;2) [[tryllid](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid)] 30-9-2008(51): Umbrella + Good: Let's go **eat** at that restaurant - the table with the _umbrella_ looks _good_.
七;seven;Note that the first stroke "cuts" through the second. This distinguishes **seven** from the character for _spoon_  (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short.;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 15-11-2005(243): This kanji is our good old **seven** , turned upside down.;2) [[Angrybeez](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez)] 10-6-2008(68): I wrote it upside down so I crossed it out.
有;possess;The picture here is of someone with a slab of _meat_ dangling _by the side_ , perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in **possession** of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh _meat_ to hang _by one's side_ until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order.;1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 7-9-2007(221): **Possess** ed by the Earth's gravity, the moon stays by its side.;2) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 12-3-2007(47): By my side I **POSSESS** a _moon of flesh_ , better known as your big ass!

Imagine _Tom Cruise_ outside in the final scene, stabbing his knife into his stomach, while _Mr T_ looks patiently on. "I pity da foo….no, really.".
論;argument;_Words_ . . . _meeting_ . . . _scrapbook_. The **argument** here is a process of academic reasoning, not a personal quarrel or spat.;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 14-8-2007(191): Right part: _academic conference_ (a _meeting_ , some of the attendees making notes in _scrapbooks_ during presentation). **Argument** at _academic conferences_ is naturally carried out using _words_.;2) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 15-10-2006(67): It's very difficult to present a good **argument** if you don't bring along a _scrapbook_ with some key _words_ jotted down to the _meeting_.
最;utmost;Sun . . . take.;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 28-8-2007(274): TAKE the **UTMOST** care when you SUN bath all DAY, or you'll get burned from your EARS to your CROTCH.;2) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 30-9-2006(148): Do your **utmost** \- seize(take) the day.
記;scribe;Words . . . snake.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 4-7-2007(165): A **scribe** writes down the _words_ spoken by a _snake_ (i.e. a lawyer).;2) [[Transtic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic)] 29-12-2007(109): **Snakes** have no hands.

(Image: Mr. T kneeling and prayering in front of a bible. "Pity me, fool.").;2) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 9-4-2007(83): **Faith** is believing that a _person_ will be true to his _word_.
初;first time;The primitives here take care of themselves: _cloak_ and _dagger_ .What I leave to you is to decide on an appropriate connotation for  " **first time** " to take advantage of them.;1) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 17-12-2007(219): "This is the **first time** we've been out of the Shire, Mr. Frodo!" Says Sam, covering himself with his cloak and clutching his dagger.;2) [[howdycowdy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy)] 4-3-2008(127): On his **FIRST TIME** , he _cloaked_ his _dagger_ with a Trojan.
問;question;Gates . . . mouth.;1) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 20-9-2006(184): A mouth on the Gates of Hell says "Answer me these **question** s three, or thru the gates ye soon will be".;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 12-10-2006(34): You begin to **question** all of the _holes_ Gates leaves in his software.

Keyword can be confused with [uncommon](../v4/1797.html) (#1797 異).
直;straightaway;Begin with the top two primitives, _needle_ and _eye_. Together they represent the _eye of a needle_. Below them is a _fishhook_ that has been **straightened out** and its barb removed so that it can pass through the _eye of the needle_.;1) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 5-10-2006(333): If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital **straightaway**.;2) [[zdude255](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdude255)] 20-3-2008(126): I caught a freaky creature with ten eyes on my fish hook, so I threw it back **straightaway**.
達;accomplished;The key word is meant to connote someone "skilled" at something. On the _road_ we find _soil_ OVER _a sheep_. You may have to work with this one a while longer.;1) [[Transtic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic)] 30-12-2007(202): Dolly (the first cloned **sheep** ever) grow tired of being a celebrity and escaped from the labs by digging a tunnel. She turned out to be an **ACCOMPLISHED** escapist, as she managed to dig a **road** under the **soil**. **/** Imagine Dolly performing a escape, like those movies where the main character has to escape from jail.;2) [[erlog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erlog)] 20-3-2007(87): The dirty sheep had come far down this road and had **accomplished** many things.
法;method;Water . . . gone.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 11-2-2007(258): This kanji shows up in a lot of words related to the legal process. Try this image: using a very outdated judicial **method** , the people of Salem dunked accused witches in the _water_ until they were all _gone_.;2) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 19-5-2007(102): There already was a [system](../v4/418.html) (#418 制) for butchering cows, a [technique](../v4/421.html) (#421 芸) for turning smoke into flowers - why can't there be a _method_ of about the same relevance for making _water_ _gone_? Evaporation anyone?
活;lively;When we speak of a **lively** personality or a **lively** party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of **lively** by having _tongues_ babble and splash around like flowing _water_.;1) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 18-5-2008(201): I'm sure I can get her pretty **lively** and _wet_ using my _tongue_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(176): Conversations can become more **lively** after everyone has had a few drinks. It's because " _water_ y _tongue_ s" loosen lips!

Think of a grid lock so bad cars are litterally scraping up against each other like people on a Japanese train during rush hour.;2) [[blaked569](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569)] 6-2-2009(148): Everybody tries to _enter_ the _road_ during rush hour. That's why it's so **crowded**.
村;town;The character for _village_ was associated with _rice fields_ (Frame 96). That for **town** , a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of _trees glued together_ to measure off the confines of a **town**.;1) [[zhangqiezi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zhangqiezi)] 29-5-2008(230): If you've ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you'll remember that every _town_ was all bordered off by a line of _trees_ with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were _glued together_ so you could only exit **town** through the main or side gates, (so you couldn't escape the important scripted scenes.).;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 3-4-2009(162): Pfft. At it's core, a **town** is just a bunch of _wood_ _glued_ together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.
語;word;Whereas the character for _say_ focused on the actual talking, that for **words** stresses the fact that although it is _I_ who _say_ them, the **words** of a language are not my own. You can see the clear distinction between _I_ and **words** just by looking at the kanji.;1) [[rosie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rosie)] 28-7-2008(226): The simplest **word** to _say_ is _I_.;2) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 15-12-2009(43): Jesus said, "I am the **WORD**.".

着;don;I cannot resist doing this one for you, since it clearly describes **donning** (putting on) one's clothes as  "pulling the _wool_ over one's _eyes_. ";1) [[mocm12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mocm12)] 20-3-2006(167): A pullover is **don** ned by pulling wool over your eyes.;2) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 11-6-2006(65): Someone who is **don** ning a disguise does that in order to pull the _wool_ over your _eyes_.
社;company;_Altar_ . . . _soil_.

門;gates;The pictograph of two swinging **gates** is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The **gates** usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.;1) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 16-1-2008(175): Heisig's stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful – first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the "sun" attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you'll get the stroke order exactly correct.;2) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 4-9-2006(56): The **gates** to Hell. guarded by Cerebus or … Bill **Gates**?
士;gentleman;The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for _soil_ by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's **gentlemen**.;1) [[gsantise](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise)] 27-8-2007(132): What a handsome **gentleman**. Standing up so straight, and broad shoulders too!! He's like a modern samurai!;2) [[mightymiff](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mightymiff)] 17-7-2009(49): A **gentleman** has broad shoulders and doesn't soil himself.
別;separate;In the Old East, the samurai and his _saber_ were never **separated**. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of **separation** -anxiety for a samurai: to be _bound up with a rope_ and unable to get at his _saber_ leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that _mouth_ bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for _tied up_ is written - just as it had been with the character for _ten thousand_.;1) [[leviathan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leviathan)] 20-3-2006(154): I don't know about you but to me this seems like someone's head is about to be **separate** d from his body. You can see he's kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.;2) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(119): A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their _mouths bound up_ to keep them quiet) in a **separate** room from his _sabers_. Putting them together would be a silly mistake.
光;ray;There are really only 2 primitives here, _little_ and _human legs_. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of  "dust" are that dance around in the light- **rays** that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as _little_ and disembodied _human legs_ , and you should have no trouble with this character.;1) [[guidedog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog)] 9-2-2007(132): A **ray** of light is not a wave but made of _little_ photons with _human legs_.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 27-9-2007(86): The **ray** from Honey I Shrunk the Kids made people _little_ \- ha! look at them run around on their tiny _legs_!
好;fond;The phrase "to be **fond** of someone " has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term "to **fondle**. " The character likens it to a _woman_ **fondling** her _child_.;1) [[snozle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snozle)] 8-10-2006(182): A _woman_ is **fond** of her _child_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(13): Women are **fond** of children.
悪;bad;Asia . . . heart.;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 26-9-2007(283): Because _Asian_ people started to eat Western food, their _hearts_ became **bad** and they started having _heart_ attacks.;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 3-3-2008(121): Asian hearts are **bad** and **evil**. They invented so much martial arts: karate, judo, kungfu, muay thai, silat, etc… just to hurt each other. They torture their own people (China, North Korea). They torture other people (Japan in China and Korea). And they are able to hide all this behind their nice facade of kindness. **Bad** , **bad** Asians. (did i shatter some people's ideas on Asia? my **bad** ).
和;harmony;Wheat . . . mouth.;1) [[skinnyneo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo)] 18-10-2007(342): The first step to **harmony** is having enough _wheat_ to feed every _mouth_ in the world. Once we are all fed it is easier to get a long in **harmony**.;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 29-1-2006(40): People who live in **harmony** with nature live in the country. they are yokels or hillbillys. See Billy-bob sitting on the porch in their denhim dungarees a sheaf of _wheat_ , sticking from their _mouth_.
重;heavy;_Thousand_ . . . _ri_. Note how the long vertical stroke doubles up to serve both elements.;1) [[erikkusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan)] 20-3-2006(321): The first computer in the world was as **heavy** as thousand computers are now.;2) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 21-4-2006(36): To me it looks like a car with two extra wheels, like a truck. As it is a very **heavy** vehicle I suggest an image of a huge mining truck, like the yellow Liebherr T282B. Remember that the first "wheel" is a bit bent. <http://www.primidi.com/2004/06/21.html>.
若;young;Here we see a _flower_ held in the _right_ hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where _flowers_ picked with the _right_ hand grant eternal **youth** , and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.;1) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 30-10-2006(165): The **young** little girl held a cute flower in her right hand.;2) [[kat1420](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kat1420)] 19-3-2008(71): **Young** love puts a _flower_ in her _right_ hand (true love puts a ring on her left!!).
花;flower;Flower . . . change.;1) [[Copycatken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken)] 24-6-2006(210): The **flower** s _change_ with the seasons.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 15-6-2006(61): The _flower_ is the essence of transience. So, the conceptual _flower_ involves both the concept of **flower** plus **change**.
底;bottom;Cave . . . calling card.;1) [[uberstuber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber)] 21-6-2007(205): I put all those useless _business cards_ at the **bottom** of a _cave_.;2) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 8-5-2007(93): At the **bottom** of the _cave_ you find a _meishi_ : "LOST? DIAL 1-800-…".
結;tie;Thread . . . aerosol can.;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 25-1-2008(168): Ok, here, you have to think of the phrase "TIE the knot" , which means a wedding (this kanji is used in the marriage compound 結婚 けっこん ). Now, at US weddings, it ends with the couple driving away with cans being dragged behind the car. So here, think of SPIDERMAN, who will **TIE** the knot with Mary Jane. At his wedding, Spider THREAD attached (or **TIE** D) to SPRAYCANS are being drug behind the limo as they drive off.;2) [[Kieron](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron)] 7-4-2008(126): _Spidey_ **ties** up the villain in a web of _threads_. " _Good luck_ getting out of that, heh heh!".
処;dispose;Both the stretching out of the _walking legs_ and the little bit of _wind_ tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or **dispose** of it.;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 16-5-2007(278): The best way to **dispose** of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear.

原;meadow;Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the **meadow** you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain **meadow** in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of  "The Sound of Music" will help.) Simply think of little _springs_ bubbling up across the **meadow** to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous _cliff_. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the _springs_ , and then falling headlong over the _cliff_ , you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory.;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 28-8-2007(148): Follow the _springs_ down the _cliff_ and you will find a nice **meadow**.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 7-2-2008(73): Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji **meadow** , used in composite words the most common meaning is **ORIGIN** … To remember just think that life may have begun in _pound_ s or _spring_ s in a land with many _cliff_ s … Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of **meadow** as the _origin_ of a huge forest.
説;explanation;Not inappropriately, this character likens an  **explanation** to the _devil's_ own _words_.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 5-2-2008(133): The _words_ of a _horny teenager_ typically fall into one of two categories: either **rumors** or **explanation** s.;2) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 11-6-2008(97): The _words_ of the _devil_ incite **rumours** and false **explanations**.
車;car;You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, **car** , provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.;1) [[Twentytw0](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0)] 19-7-2007(151): My **car** is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.;2) [[saranich](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich)] 20-1-2006(17): Actually, this is a 10x10 **car** that can get you through a rice field.
起;rouse;Run . . . snake.;1) [[onsen_monkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey)] 26-9-2006(181): Be careful when you're RUNNING through the jungle, because you might step on and **ROUSE** a sleeping SNAKE. Then you'll have to RUN like hell before it bites you!;2) [[mfistik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mfistik)] 16-10-2007(97): Nothing will **rouse** you quite as much as finding a snake in your bed. You will run away like you've never run before!
字;character;Here is the character for **character** itself. Not just kanji, but any written **character** from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a _child_ in a _house_. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a _child_ born to a Japanese _house_ is given **characters** for its name, so it is also stamped with the **character** of those who raise it from infancy on.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(110): CHILDren learn Kanji **character** s underneath a HOUSE.;2) [[komodo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo)] 22-6-2008(82): "Why do I have to wear this roof on my head all the time father?" "Shut up! It builds **character**!".
流;current;_Water_ . . . _infant_ . . . _flood_. Be sure to distinguish the two water primitives from one another in making your story.;1) [[Dragg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragg)] 21-11-2007(254): INFANT Moses placed in the WATER and sent down the **current** of the STREAM.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(57): A water-breathing infant (genetically modified?) is caught in a flood, and drifts with the **current** , apparently enjoying himself in the process.
吉;good luck;Here we see a _samurai_ standing on a street with an open _mouth_ , which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for **good luck**.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-2-2007(310): The _samurai_ 's wife gives him a (uhum) before battle for **good luck**.;2) [[jonobugs](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonobugs)] 27-5-2008(117): A true samurai gentleman will always mouth, " **Good luck** " to his opponents before a match.
点;spot;If you look into the flickering of a _fire_ for a long time and then turn aside, you will see **spots** before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those **spots** as a technique for _fortune-telling_. The old witch sits before her _cauldron_ and watches the **spots** that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that _tells your fortune_. Think of it as a kind of **spot** -check on your future.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(226): The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the **spot** because she was accused of being a witch.;2) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 12-6-2008(138): You have to stimulate the G-spot with your _magic wand_ in order to get her on _fire_. Or you can juste use your _mouth_ …
他;other;Person . . . scorpion.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 7-3-2007(161): It's one or the **other** : fight _Mr. T_ , or be thrown into the _scorpion_ pit.;2) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 25-7-2006(67): Old latin saying: homo hominis scorpio ( _people_ are _scorpions_ to **other** _people_ ).
想;concept;To distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame, focus on the sense of the "con-" in the word " **concept**. " Its elements are: _inter-_ . . . _heart_.;1) [[cheechuan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan)] 29-11-2007(364): The **concept** of love is basically two _hearts_ _inter_ -acting as one.;2) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 16-4-2008(61): _''Inter-heart''_ is a new therapy _CONCEPT_ that helps macho guys share their feelings with each other.
校;exam;Tree . . . mingle.;1) [[richcoop](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop)] 28-6-2012(209): The schools that accepted them were posted on a TREE, the students MINGLED around trying to find their names. (コオ）.;2) [[JetSetArnett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett)] 12-3-2009(136): Note: this Kanji does _not_ mean **exam**. It means school. I find this keyword an choice odd as **school** by itself is not used elsewhere. **Exam** ples: 校長 is principal (lit. school chief), 中学校 is junior high school (lit. middle study/knowledge school).
義;righteousness;Sheep . . . ego.;1) [[jyoung](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jyoung)] 21-7-2006(388): Righteous Christians are sheep with egos (reworked from raulir, fixes word order to match radical order).;2) [[lynbroughton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lynbroughton)] 24-6-2007(87): Follow the path of **RIGHTEOUSNESS** like _sheep_ follow the shepherd , let go of your _ego_.

Think less about "I" (あい) and more about "we".;2) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 17-3-2008(156): The man is about to enter the ' _birdhouse_ ' (brothel) when he remembers his true _love_ at home, and, following his _heart_ , uses his _walking legs_ to go straight home.
百;hundred;The Japanese refer to a person's 99th birthday as a " _white_ year " because _white_ is the kanji you are left with if you subtract _one_ from a **hundred**.;1) [[noushina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina)] 30-12-2006(152): 100 turned sideways. sort of the same as what ashoksaraf said.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-9-2007(89): That dirty ceiling was painted WHITE a **hundred** times!
我;ego;_Hand_ . . . _fiesta_. Note how the second stroke of the _hand_ is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for _fiesta_.

化;change;Person . . . spoon.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 30-12-2005(117): Referring to a scene in the movie "The Matrix" where a girl bends a spoon with the power of her mind alone, I imagine _Mister T_ who **change** s a _spoon_ into something else (maybe the waiter forgot to bring knives or forks). Note: as a primitive, it can help to use the image of "spare **change** ", this can help you keep it distinct from other similar kanji such as "shape" or "turn into".;2) [[ezmoreldo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo)] 3-4-2008(95): I just see this one as a pictograph of a person changing position and sitting down.
古;old;The primitive elements that compose this character are _ten_ and _mouth_ , but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with **old** inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character  "drawings.";1) [[Thaliel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thaliel)] 8-7-2006(191): Tombstone and cross on an **old** man's grave.;2) [[rajivp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rajivp)] 31-10-2007(76): You get **OLD** fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.
置;placement;Eye . . . straightaway.;1) [[icamonkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey)] 11-8-2008(287): Working in retail you learn the **placement** of any item should be at _eye_ level so it's seen _straightaway_.;2) [[jimsublimeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman)] 30-10-2007(188): On the JET Programme, many people have their _eye_ on a **placement** in Tokyo, Osaka or another big city, and write it on their application form. They are usually sent to the countryside _straightaway_.
命;fate;This character connotes life in general, but also the particular life that is **fated** one by virtue of the distinctive character with which one is born. Its elements are: _fit_ . . . _stamp_. The bottom portion of _fit_ is nudged to the left in order to make room for the _stamp_.;1) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 1-6-2007(240): When you're born, your **fate** is measured, _fitted_ , and _stamped_ onto your soul. Good luck defying it.;2) [[tharvey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey)] 19-7-2009(109): It is your **fate** to _meet_ with a _mouth_ , young _postage stamp_.
違;difference;Locket . . . road.;1) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 30-8-2006(221): You lose your precious _locket_ on the _road_ to somewhere. You ask people if they've seen it, but no luck. "Just buy another one," someone says. "I mean, what's the **difference**?" Then of course you say "Well, it makes a huge **difference**!! Since it has sentimental value, I don't want a different one! " Then of course they understand.;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 17-2-2008(68): You loose your LOCKET on the ROAD and report it to the 交番 . They find one, and show it to you. 「これですか？」 But it's the wrong one… You say, 「いいえ。。 **違います** 。。」.
如;likeness;Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the _mouth_ of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a _woman_ gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a **likeness** to the _opening_ of the _woman_ from whom you were born.;1) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 17-7-2008(363): _Women_ share a common **likeness**. Their _mouth_ s are always open, whining about this and that.;2) [[At0m5k](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k)] 21-8-2008(133): A _woman_ 's _mouth_ has the **likeness** of a vaccum cleaner, it's noisy and all it's good for is sucking. Do not confuse with [resemblance](../v4/114.html) (#114 肖). **Likeness** is purely conceptual, whereas resemblance refers to actual physical similarities.
朝;morning;On the right we see the _moon_ fading off into the first light of **morning** , and to the left, the _mist_ that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the _moon_ tilting over to spill _mist_ on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character.;1) [[Rinifett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett)] 25-9-2007(186): There is mist as the moon fades away in the **morning**.;2) [[Yasser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser)] 19-10-2008(96): **Morning** has come "ten" hours "early"!!! The "moon" is still in the sky!
返;return;Anti- . . . road.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 7-5-2006(121): Pretty obvious: to **return** is to turn back on the road you're on and go the opposite way.;2) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 16-7-2008(98): **Return** here means "return something" rather than "go back". So here it goes, for those of you who are also suffering of the Japanese summer ,-) I ordered an _anti_ mosquito kit, but it was damaged on the _way_ so I had to **return** it.
関;connection;Gates . . . golden calf.;1) [[Rakushun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun)] 27-12-2007(150): The _golden calf_ is sent to the _gates of Hell_ for it's **connection** to false idols.;2) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 8-7-2008(75): There's a weird **connection** between worshipping the _golden calf_ and visiting the _gates of Hell_.
数;number;Rice . . . woman . . . taskmaster.;1) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 4-4-2007(264): Young _taskmaster_ is learning **numbers** by watching _women_ haul sacks of _rice_ past him. "One… two… four! No, wrong! Go back, go back!".;2) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 20-8-2006(79): _Women_ toil in the _rice_ fields carrying heavy sacks of _rice_ to be **number** ed and counted by the _taskmaster_.
氏;family name;Pay close attention to the stroke order of the elements when learning to write this character. The elements: a long _drop_ . . . _fishhook_ . . . a _one_ . . . _fishhook_.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 12-11-2007(239): Looks a bit like Ft => **F** amily **t** itle => **Family name**.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 19-10-2006(75): The **family name** is important to me! _Drop_ me from a building, torture me with a _fishhook_ , I'm keeping my _one_ **family name**. Hook me with a second _fishhook_ , I refuse to change my **family name**.
石;stone;With a _mouth_ under a _cliff_ , what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great **stone** has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the _Arabian Nights_ should be enough to push the **stone** aside. But take care - the _cliff_ is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in _cliff_ will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 31-12-2007(142): Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of _cliff_ just in time to evade the huge **STONE** rolling out of the _mouth_ of the cave!;2) [[Nayelianne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nayelianne)] 19-9-2008(37): There's a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the _cliff_ thing isn't working for you… Just see it as a **stone** [いし] being _hammered_ by a miner searching for jewel **stone** s [ほう **せき** ] ,).
早;early;This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the _sun_ flower, since it begins with the element for _sun_ and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine _sun_ flowers with _needles_ for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of **early** is easily remembered if one thinks of the _sun_ flower as the **early** riser in the garden, because the _sun_ , showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(290): The _sun_ up is **early** , well before _ten_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(34): An **early** sun-flower looks like a miniature sun perched on a needlelike stems.
海;sea;Behind _every drop of water_ , a **sea** from which it originated.;1) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 6-12-2007(184): _Every_ drop of _water_ will eventually return to the **sea**.;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 9-8-2008(22): As depicted in the classic SF film _Fantastic Voyage_ , every drop of water is a **sea** , if you look close enough. Imagine peering through a microscope at a vast **sea** teeming with microbial life (and perhaps a minaturized submarine). **Note:** Take care not to confuse with [ocean](../v4/549.html) (#549 洋).
常;usual;Outhouse . . . towel.;1) [[Avispa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa)] 31-8-2007(236): It's **usual** to take your _towel_ with your when you go to the _outhouse_ at the onsen (hot springs bath in Japan) so everybody doesn't see your stuff.;2) [[Asgard](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asgard)] 2-9-2006(91): In the _outhouse_ toilet you'd **usual** ly hope to find toilet paper to wipe your ass. If it's already gone, which is **usual** ly the case, simply use the _towel_.
付;adhere;_Person_ . . . _glue_. The few cases in which this character serves as a primitive should include some connotation of  " **adhering** to " that distinguishes it from " _glued to_. " Two examples follow.;1) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 15-6-2009(567): 賀 TO EVERYONE WHO MADE IT TO 千 kanji!! Remember, after this, you'll be 読 ing japanese novels, the news, and the internet like a native. 吉 to ALL of you in your amazing japanese 往 . :).;2) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 13-2-2007(172): If a PERSON **ADHERE** S to something, they stick to it like GLUE.
九;nine;If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for _power_ (Frame 922).;1) [[joeyjpm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joeyjpm)] 15-7-2008(161): _Warning - naughty reminder_ A woman in the doggie style position, waiting for my **NINE** inches.;2) [[Gunii](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gunii)] 12-2-2008(157): Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1 一 with the kanji of 8 八 added. So think of it as [一＋八＝九](midori://search?text=一＋八＝九) .
解;unravel;Angle . . . dagger . . . cow.;1) [[ergerg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg)] 25-11-2006(221): Did you know that you can **unravel** a cow? If you stick the dagger in at exactly the correct angle, the whole cow will just **unravel**.;2) [[richcoop](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop)] 20-7-2009(77): **Unravel** the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.
土;soil;I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of **soil** piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.;1) [[mparrett1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mparrett1)] 18-6-2006(87): Remembering **soil** is easy. If **soil** is soft, you can take a _walking stick_ and plunge it two* feet into the ground.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 11-3-2008(32): The grave was marked by a cross sticking out of the **soil**.
戸;door;Ceiling . . . flag.;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 10-12-2005(272): Traditional Japanese storefront **door** s have several _flags_ , known as "noren," hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don't usually hang from the _ceiling_.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 30-12-2006(37): A Japanese **door** has a noren, a _flag_ hanging from a _rod_. (I give this primitive the meaning of a noren-covered **door** ).
東;east;As a "Western" language, English identifies the **east** with the rising _sun_. In more fanciful terms, we see the _sun_ piercing through a _tree_ as it rises in the **east**.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-1-2006(182): Traditionally seen as a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree.;2) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 7-12-2008(15): Through the _tree_ s, I watch the _sun_ rising from the **east**.
火;fire;Just as sitting before a **fire** enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of **fire** you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 22-2-2008(57): For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on **fire**!;2) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 16-6-2008(29): A tepee getting shot at by **fire** arrows.
之;of;This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 4-11-2007(292): **Of** all the kanji, this is the only one 之 orro can write.;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 31-1-2008(110): The Z **of** Zorro (and yes he has a hat).
要;need;Old West . . . woman.;1) [[takoman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman)] 9-6-2008(106): (ヨウ) When Clint **need** s a woman, he likes to be on top.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 27-9-2008(99): In the _Old West_ , _women_ were **need** ed because nobody knew how to cook or clean.
苦;suffering;The picture of **suffering** we are given here is that of a _flower_ that has grown _old_. When a _flower_ ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even **suffers**. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.;1) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 20-9-2006(190): Flowers for the old man **suffering** in the hospital.;2) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 9-5-2007(26): The derivates from opium _poppies_ such as morphine can be used to tame the **suffering** of the _old_.
過;overdo;Jawbone . . . road.;1) [[Talka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka)] 9-9-2007(256): Jaws XII~! Jaws strikes the highway! Man, they're really **overdo** ing it now.;2) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 4-9-2006(180): In 'American History X' Edward Norton's character **overdoes** it when he makes the dude that tried to steal his car lie face down with his _jawbone_ open over the pavement of the _roadway_ and then stamps on the back of his head. My teeth still tingle when I think of that!
定;determine;**Determination** , in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to _mending_ one's _house_.;1) [[jrothenberg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jrothenberg)] 31-1-2007(231): In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher's HOUSE in various ways.;2) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 25-1-2007(88): Prior to buying a home, the _home_ inspector will come into your house and **determine** everything that needs _mending_.
町;village;_Street_ signs standing at the corner of the _rice fields_ depict the **village** limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.);1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 19-11-2006(150): Actually this means **town** , like one that has lots of _streets_ and is surrounded by all the _rice fields_.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 20-8-2008(84): Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. "Pillage the **village** , for the _rice_ and and the _tea_." the street primitive on the right looks like a 't'.
安;relax;To be told that the place of the _woman_ is in the _house_ may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of **relaxing** after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary _woman_ of the _house_ slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.;1) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 27-3-2007(142): It's funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive… well… if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman **relax** ing. Cheapest place to do that is in one's own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? [家で休暇を取るは安いですね。](midori://search?text=家で休暇を取るは安いですね。) .;2) [[enerccio](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enerccio)] 22-7-2007(83): You can only **relax** , when you have woman under roof to do all chores.
庫;warehouse;Cave . . . car.;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 3-11-2005(372): I think of the Batcave. It's a big cave that Batman uses as a **warehouse** to store his car, the Batmobile, and all his cool big-boy toys.;2) [[dizzwave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dizzwave)] 17-6-2008(28): Have you ever worked in a **warehouse**? It's like a giant metal _cave_. Watch out for that _forklift_!
助;help;_Shelf_ . . . _power_. The reason why the _shelf_ appears on the left here is that the right side is the normal position for power, the stronger primitive. Indeed, the only exception in all the kanji is the character for _add_ (Frame 932).;1) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 2-5-2007(228): **HELP**! Someone's pinned under this bookshelf and it's gonna take a lot of muscle to lift it off!;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 12-4-2007(84): Can you **help** me move this _shelf_? I don't have the _muscle_ to do it alone.
頃;about that time;When Uncle Bob starts his comic routine of sticking _spoons_ on his _head_ , you know it is **about that time**  to come up with a reason to excuse yourself.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 24-6-2007(164): An alarm clock with a unique design: You set it for, say, 7:00 am, and at **about that time** the clock reaches out with a _spoon_ and hits you on the _head_.;2) [[cameron_en](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en)] 29-11-2008(47): After _spooning_ for hours it's **about that time** he got some _head_. Dayum woman.
民;people;In place of the _drop_ at the start of the character for _family name_ , we have a _mouth_ , which makes you think of the "vox populi.";1) [[burento5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burento5)] 22-6-2008(150): How many of you know what "vox populi" means?;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 12-3-2007(139): All the **people** of the world with all their _family names_ shouting with their big _mouths_.
半;half;Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a _little needle_ \- the kind used for splitting hairs in **half**. (Again, according to rule, _little_ takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.);1) [[bspeaks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bspeaks)] 26-1-2008(361): Imagine karate chopping the number three in **half** with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first "board" breaks.;2) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 15-3-2009(38): I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in **half** and there are still two more to go.
又;or again;Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate "and" (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of **or again**.;1) [[sindhikara](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara)] 1-8-2008(155): This keyword should really be "again" not "or again" Here is some context: think of the phrase "Jya mata" " じゃ又 " which is a farewell similar to "then again". Also "Mata ne" " 又ね " and mata ashita (again tomorrow) " 又明日 "。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out "mata" except for in the last example: 又明日 .;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 16-4-2007(132): After her boyfriend's _crotch_ has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, " **Or again** , we could fool around . . . ".
集;gather;_Turkeys_ . . . atop a _tree_.;1) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 30-8-2007(198): Hunter-gathers, searching all along the ground for food. They never look up and see the Turkeys that have **gather** ed on top of the trees to hide. Those were some smart turkeys!;2) [[dsamari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dsamari)] 14-10-2007(110): **Gather** the turkeys for Thanksgiving. **Gather** the trees for Christmas. In that order…
誰;who;Words . . . turkey.;1) [[cameron_en](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en)] 28-11-2008(87): Do you remember that song where they _say_ " **Who** let the _turkeys_ out!? Gobble.. gobble.. gobble"?;2) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 5-2-2007(40): [who, someone, somebody] You're alone when, suddenly, you think you hear someone _speak_ ing. " **Who** 's there?", you _say_ , but there is no answer. Then you find out it was only a _turkey_ gobbling. You feel relieved (and ashamed to tell this story). (Based on raulir).
供;submit;**Submit** here is a transitive verb, meaning to offer or present. Its elements: _person_ . . . _strung together_.;1) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 1-10-2007(178): It took over 600 frames for _Mr T_ to [make](../v4/1142.html) (#1142 作), the _Ark_ , but when he was finally done, he cast his saw aside and **submit** ted the _Ark_ to Noah for his approval. "I pity the foo who doesn't climb aboard this ark," said Noah to his friend.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 11-12-2006(69): _Mr. T_ **submits** a resume _together_ with his application. "I pity da foo don't got no resume!" he says.
飛;fly;The two _large hooks_ have little propellers (the two _drops_ on each _hook_ ) attached to them for **flying**. Beneath is the _measuring box_ , which serves as the body of this **flying** contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 1-1-2007(267): Hooks with small wings attached look like hummingbirds with a long beak. Two hummingbirds are trying to **fly** away with our little measuring box. What do they want it for?;2) [[joxn_costello](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello)] 5-2-2009(36): Two _hummingbirds_ **fly** ing to feed at a _measuring box_ filled with sugar water. **This kanji is famous for having hard-to-remember stroke order.** Try it this way: first a _hummingbird_ **flies** over the _measuring box walls backwards_. But finally the other _hummingbird_ manages to stick its beak right through them.
申;speaketh;The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb "to speak." It is written by a _tongue wagging in the mouth_ with a _walking stick_ rammed through it and coming out at both ends.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-8-2006(181): I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the "s" and **speaketh** like thith becauth they have a _cane_ in their _mouth_.;2) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 14-2-2008(90): I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 [sayeth](../v4/578.html) (#578 曰). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in "moshi moshi" when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say "hello, this is X **speaking**.".
在;exist;Genie in the bottle . . . soil.;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 24-7-2007(276): Genie in the bottle does **exist** but you need to dig deep into the soil to find one.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 24-1-2008(66): You wipe the _soil_ from the bottle, only to have a genie float out above you, saying: 'I am the _genie in a bottle_ , what is your wish?' So now you know that they do **exist**.
兵;soldier;Hill . . . animal legs.;1) [[hirai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hirai)] 15-10-2007(265): Listen up **soldier** s! We're going to take that _hill_. You are no longer men with human legs. You are voracious animals, with _animal legs_! Got it? _Animal legs_! Now take that hill!;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 21-5-2007(73): The _hill_ is so steep that you almost have to have _animal legs_ to walk on it. However, the **soldiers** have no problem because they've been trained to march there.
開;open;Gates . . . two hands.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 2-6-2007(146): Sure you can squeeze through these _gates_ by kicking them or pushing them with your body, but if you want to get them wide **open** , you need to do that with _both your hands_.;2) [[shirish](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirish)] 3-2-2009(132): To **open** the _gate_ , use your _both hands_.
草;grass;Perhaps you know the custom of seeding **grass** randomly or in some particular pattern with the _flower_ called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in _early_ spring. As the **grass** begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny _flowers_ dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of **grass** somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in _flowers_ once as a sort of _early_ harbinger of spring.;1) [[dicedice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice)] 22-7-2007(266): **Grass** grows in _earlier_ than _flowers_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 1-6-2008(46): This **grass** is very long. The only _flowers_ you can see are _sunflowers_ – the rest are hidden by the **grass**.
強;strong;_Vast_ . . . _insect_. Note how the _elbow_ of _vast_ is shrunken and elevated to make room for the _insect_ beneath.;1) [[jaresty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty)] 10-11-2007(176): An insect who can fly vast distances is **strong**.;2) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 19-7-2006(106): The _vast_ majority of _insect_ s are pretty **strong** , ants can carry 10x their weight!
紙;paper;Thread . . . family name.;1) [[Jasta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jasta)] 8-11-2008(225): _Spiderman_ doesn't have a single **paper** with his _family name_ on it (because he doesn't want to reveal his identity).;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 4-12-2005(79): I imagine a ridiculously expensive, and rather pointless, Japanese type of **paper** for writing letters, with one's _family name_ woven in _fine thread_ somewhere in a corner.
深;deep;Water . . . paper punch . . . tree.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 12-9-2006(277): If the groper's _"tree"_ goes up the girl's _miniskirt_ too **deep** , he'll ejaculate _fluid_. (Sorry it's kinda coarse but it works.).;2) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 24-8-2007(69): Thrown in **deep** water, the Japanese School girl tries to reach a floating tree to save herself.
待;wait;Line . . . Buddhist temple.;1) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 7-10-2007(189): A _line_ queued up outside the _Buddhist temple_ , **waiting** to see the shrine on New Year's Day.;2) [[the_marshal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal)] 2-2-2006(63): The COLUMNS of this TEMPLE are a well-know meeting spot. You can always see someone **WAIT** ING there.
機;mechanism;Tree . . . abacus.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 22-10-2006(261): An _abacus_ is a **mechanism** made of _wood_ used to calculate _how many_ 'anythings'.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 14-1-2008(75): To avoid confusing with [contraption](../v4/677.html) (#677 械), focus on the "ism" of **mechanism**. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish, **mechanism** here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable _tree_ (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching _abacus_ that smashes enemies between its giant beads.
決;decide;The etymology of **decide** (de-cidere = cut off) will help here, the elements are: _water_ . . . _guillotine_.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 28-4-2007(261): " **Decide**!" " **Decide**?! Death by drowning in polluted _water_ or death by _guillotine_. How can I **decide**?" I asked.;2) [[cangy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy)] 2-4-2008(108): To **decide** if someone is a witch or not first dunk them in _water_. If they don't drown they are a witch and can be sent to the _guillotine_.
遠;distant;A **distant** figure on the _road_ is such a blur it looks like a _lidded crock_ wearing a silk _scarf_.;1) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 16-3-2007(319): Keep **distant** from a _lidded crock_ on the _road_ wrapped in a _scarf_. It might be a bomb.;2) [[eieneverafter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eieneverafter)] 3-3-2008(27): When traveling to a **distant** land, what better way of keeping warm on the road is there than carrying a warm lidded crock and wearing a scarf?
題;topic;In many kinds of research, one can find information on a given **topic** only if the _headings_ are prepared _just so_.;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 26-7-2007(279): The "TOPIC" of the day's newspaper must be placed JUST SO at the top of the PAGE to attract attention.;2) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 28-8-2007(76): You spend ALL DAY, mending your socks JUST SO. Then you have a look at the HEADING of the newspaper. The **topic** —FREE SOCKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!!

It sits in trees all day and shoots out sparks as it sings.
利;profit;_Wheat_ . . . _saber_. Be careful not to confuse with _gain_ (Frame 941) or _earnings_ (Frame 959).;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 30-12-2007(241): 1. Steal a bunch of wheat from a wheat field by cutting it down with your saber. 2. ????? 3. **Profit**!;2) [[ivoSF](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF)] 4-8-2006(201): In the middle ages there where only 2 ways for peasantry to make a **profit**. one by being a farmer, 2 to be a mercenary and live by the way of the sword.
張;lengthen;Bow . . . long.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 29-10-2006(238): The longbow is follows the design of a standard _bow_ , only it has been **lengthen** ed.;2) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 14-8-2007(71): _Legolas_ recieves spam telling him that his can **lengthen** his "bow"…he smirks…he know's it's already _long_ enough.
余;too much;_Umbrella_ . . . _potato_ . . . _little_. The last stroke of _potato_ and the first of _little_ coincide in this character.;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 11-7-2007(183): You hang an _umbrella_ upside-down on a hook of the **scales** and fill it with _little_ _potatoes_. No luck: it weights **too much**.;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 7-3-2008(147): This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means **too little** in negative sentences and **too much** in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol " >" ( **more than** , another meaning!!) as the _umbrella_ component, and using [two](../v4/2.html) (#2 二) and [little](../v4/105.html) (#105 小) for the _potato_ primitive. So, this kanji either means " _two_ much" (more than 2) or " _two little_ ". (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).
皆;all;Think of the housewives in TV commercials " _comparing_ the _whiteness_ " of their laundry across the fence, a typical advertisement for the popular detergent known as **All**. (If you don't know the brand, surely you've heard the phrases  " **all** -purpose detergent" or " **all** -temperature detergent.");1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 25-1-2007(227): If you _compare_ colors, you will find that _white_ is produced from the mix of **all** the others.;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 29-1-2008(141): Sometimes, Dr. Heisig's keyword choices are really quite bizarre. This doesn't mean **all** , it means **everyone**!! Picture two ku klux klansmen _comparing_ whose _skin_ is whiter…finally, they agree that **everyone** there is white.
必;invariably;First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the _heart_ , even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph "dividing" _the heart_ in half, then one has one of those **invariably** true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each _heart_ is divided into two halves.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 27-10-2007(203): You swear you'll be in love forever, but **invariably** there comes a time when your _heart_ is _divided_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 12-6-2008(97): For this kanji I **invariably** got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost _heart_ , but decided to _stick_ (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly), 2) fishhook, 3) two drops. Now I **invariably** get it right.
歌;song;The **song** in this kanji is being sung by a chorus line of _can-can_ girls. Why it should be eliciting nothing but _yawning_ from the audience, I leave to you to decide.;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 4-4-2008(138): **Can- Can** -ers **lack** the ability to sing a **song** , so they just dance.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-12-2006(64): _Can-can_ dancers are supposed to be big-bosomed girls who dance. Yet these so called can-can dancers are flat-chested and singing a **song** , so audience of men is _yawn_ ing in boredom.
打;strike;Finger . . . spike.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 30-1-2007(258): You're using a hammer to drive a _nail_ into a plank, but you miss and **strike** your _fingers_ , ouch ! PS: the character does not mean "to go on **strike** ", it will be very helpful in the long run to create images that convey the proper sense of the character!;2) [[Wosret](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret)] 23-2-2009(43): My teacher used to **strike** my **finger** s with a **street sign**.
呼;call;_Mouth_ . . . _water lily_. Note: this is the one time that the  "stem" has a barb at the end. Work this fact into your story.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 9-5-2007(270): I'm a lazy fisher, so I genetically engineered a _lily pad_ with a _fishing hook at the stem_ and a _mouth_ to **call** me whenever it catches something.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(69): I just follow the **calls** from the frogs _mouths_ on the _lily pads_ to _hook_ them.
根;root;Tree . . . silver.;1) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 28-10-2007(227): Since trees eat through their **root** s, one could imagine **root** s as _tree silver_ ware.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 1-3-2007(109): The **root** s of the magical _tree_ are _silver_.
覚;memorize;The idea of **memorizing** things is easily related to the _schoolhouse_ , and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that **memorizing** involves _seeing_ things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together.;1) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 25-4-2008(180): In a _schoolhouse_ in class: 1) you _see_ something on the blackboard, then 2) you **memorize** it.;2) [[cerulean](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean)] 1-7-2008(82): You'll never **memorize** all the kanji by _seeing_ them in a _school house_. You need Heisig and RtK!
老;old man;First, do not confuse this character with _venerable old man_ (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an **old man** begins with an abbreviation of the character for _somebody_ , the _nose_ having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the _soil_ drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when  "dust to dust" begins to take on a personal meaning, the diagonal _walking stick_ for getting around, and the _spoon_ for being spoon- fed.;1) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 18-12-2006(200): An **old man** , wondering what it's like in a grave, _sits_ in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with _soil_ , the **old man** saves himself by flailing his _walking stick_ in the air.;2) [[aphasiac](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac)] 14-8-2009(71): The _dirty_ **old man** had a _stroke_ so now he must be _spoon_ fed.
京;capital;When we think of a **capital**  city today we think of _tall_  skyscrapers dwarfing the endless swarms of _little_  folk scurrying here and there about their business.;1) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 21-9-2006(243): Tokyo, **capital** of Japan: _tall_ buildings, _small_ people (compared to the buildings).;2) [[Cirion](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cirion)] 20-7-2008(69): The **capital** is where the powerful act formal wearing _top hats_ , open their _mouth_ s, and get _little_ done.
由;wherefore;The " **wherefore** " of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a _rice field_ sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and **wherefore** of the seed's falling in the earth and dying.

(Juliet has fallen in love with a brussel sprout) (OR: A brussel sprout has fallen from Juliet's dinner plate and rolled off).;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 16-1-2008(152): "Cogito **ergo** sum." **Wherefore** is a bad choice here for two reasons. For one, it's often mistranslated as "where" when in fact it's an urge to know a cause or reason, and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought _sprouts_ from my _brain_. I think, **therefore** I am.].
品;goods;As in the character for _sparkle_ , the triplication of a single element in this character indicates "everywhere" or "heaps of." When we think of **goods** in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass- produced - that is to say, produced for the  "masses" of open _mouths_ waiting like fledglings in a nest to  "consume" whatever comes their way.;1) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(93): _Three boxes_ of **goods** are devoured by the hungry _mouths_ of waiting consumers.;2) [[graham6565](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/graham6565)] 16-5-2007(68): Three hungry mouths waiting for the **goods** to come.

STORY: Scientists have developed a new **SPECIES** of WHEAT that has large HEAVY seeds. Now we can feed the world.
連;take along;What you are meant to **take along** in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the _car_ on the _road_ should ground your image for picking up your friends to _take_ them _along_ to wherever you are going.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 16-9-2007(161): When you put your _car_ on the _road_ you should always **take along** a few friends.

Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the "Union" in Soviet Union and the "United" of United Nations (the countries that "go along with each other" at least some of the time).

Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an _eyedropper_ alongside the number _ten_ to make it a **thousand**.;1) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 26-2-2006(136): It takes many drops of ten to get to a **thousand**.;2) [[toddiceton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/toddiceton)] 4-11-2008(108): _One_ T = one **thousand**.

島;island;The _bird's tail_ is tucked under here, because it has come to stop on a _mountain_ to rest from its journey across the waters. Thus the kanji comes to mean an **island**.;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 7-5-2006(176): This **island** is the home of the terrible mythical bird Roc.

左;left;By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: _by one's side_ . . . _craft_.

Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a **world** so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the _rice fields_ ). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being **jammed into** that already narrow space.;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 22-8-2007(116): One Japanese farmer I know is so small minded that he thinks the entire **world** is JAMMED IN the borders of his little RICE FIELD.;2) [[eltjopoort](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort)] 12-5-2008(93): A famous philosopher once said that his **world** consisted of all the things he could _jam into_ his _brain_.

Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been **ship** ped off to a combat zone. He's riding in the _boat_ overseas to fight in the _trenches_ ( _gulley_ ).
元;beginning;"In the **beginning**... " starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made _two_ of them, man and woman. While we presume she made _two_ of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only   _two_ and a pair of _human legs_ come to the kanji that means **beginning**.;1) [[mukade](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mukade)] 10-7-2007(236): In the **beginning** were just _two_ who walked on _human legs_.;2) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(71): In the **beginning** God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work.

God nodded, and the middle breast fell off… and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, "Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?" And God created man. That's why the women today only have _two_ boobs to match their _two human legs_.

I _saw_ it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my **outlook** completely.

西;west;To our way of counting directions, the **west** always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for _four_ in this kanji. But since we want only _one_ of the _four_ directions, the **west** adds the _one_ at the top and sucks the _human legs_ a bit out of their _mouth_ in the process.;1) [[guidedog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog)] 9-2-2007(224): The old **west** represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare [sign of the bird](../v4/1427.html) (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full).;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.

Then let the element _arrow_ and _craft_ stand for the well-known **style** of shirts known as  " _Arrow_ shirts " because of the little _arrow_ sewn on each one.;1) [[kiisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu)] 17-2-2008(196): Each Indian tribe crafts their arrows in a certain **style**..;2) [[shirahime](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime)] 20-8-2006(64): The latest **style** is shirts crafted out of arrows.
番;turn;This key word has been chosen for its overlay of several meanings similar to those of the kanji: a **turn** of duty, a round, a number, and so forth.

They roll the _dice_ to decide in what order they have to keep watch and when everyones **turn** is.
程;extent;_Wheat_ . . . _display_.

伝;transmit;_Person_ . . . _rising cloud_. Hint: the Amerindians' smoke signal scan help provide a good image for this kanji, whose key word is meant to include **transmissions** of all sorts.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 21-10-2005(295): Mister T **transmit** s a message with rising clouds (smoke) signals, to a nearby American Indian tribe.

In that one, there was a car so you could take along your friends once you found them on the road.

果;fruit;The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the _tree_ ) and comes to fruition, producing **fruit** full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for _brains_ at the top, which might prove more helpful than _rice field_ for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a _sun_ with a _tree_ whose trunk runs through the _sun_.;1) [[vionnacrowe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vionnacrowe)] 11-3-2007(259): If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden **fruit** from the tree.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 24-7-2006(55): There really are _brain_ **fruit** _trees_.

I'd rather listen to the _words_ of a lecture than attend a _kazoo_ concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).
寄;draw near;Let the idea of **drawing near** suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a _strange house_ \- perhaps the haunted _House_ of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread _House_ that lured Hansel and Gretel to **draw near**.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 14-11-2007(195): The _strange house_ has a sign saying "DRAW NEAR" in its window, instead of a 'Beware' sign.

It died and fell down, ending up **sideways**.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 11-3-2007(75): In a horrible accident, a _yellow_ schoolbus gets wrapped **sideways** around a _tree_.

友;friend;By one's side . . . crotch.;1) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 10-1-2007(143): A good **friend** is always at your side. —- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other's crotches in a joking manner. It's still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor's crotch is a great way to express **friend** ship.;2) [[nakome](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome)] 4-3-2008(111): Think of a sex **friend** (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a _crotch by your side_. (the Japanese refer to such a **friend** as セフレ, just as we do).
非;un-;This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to " **un-** " is but a short step.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 8-10-2006(142): This looks like a pictogram of 3 fingers from each hand trying to open up a crack in a wall. That's an **un-** believable way to escape from prison OR the **UN-** have a prison in the Hague.;2) [[greenapple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple)] 1-5-2006(109): People in the jail cell are **un-** friendly, **un-** comely, and **un-** cooperative.

婦;lady;Woman . . . broom . . . apron.;1) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 7-2-2008(252): In high society, a **lady** is a _woman_ who never touches a _broom_ or an _apron_.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 8-10-2007(114): The **LADY** of the house is nothing more than a WOMAN who's a HOUSEWIFE (BROOM and APRON anyone?).
共;together;_Salad_ . . . _animal legs_.;1) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 1-10-2007(256): The character for [deluge](../v4/1799.html) (#1799 洪) gave me the idea to use **together** as a primitive for _Noah's Ark_.

寝;lie down;Do not confuse this key word with either the element for _reclining_ or the character for _prostrated_ (Frame 1035). Its primitive elements are: _house_ . . . _turtle_ . . . _broom_ . . . _crown_ . . . _crotch_.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-12-2007(209): After work, the _French maid_ goes _home_ and lies down with a _turtle_.

He hasn't made a single sale today, so he doesn't have enough money to buy a pillow. He lies down on his pet _turtle_ and cries himself to sleep.
酒;saké;Water . . . whiskey bottle.;1) [[greenapple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple)] 27-8-2006(176): **Sake** is just watered down whisky.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 13-6-2007(86): **Sake** is the generic term for alcohol (not just japanese rice wine). And a very popular alcoholic drink in Japan is _whiskey_ and _water_.
失;lose;"To **lose** " here takes the sense of "misplace," not the sense of _defeat_ , whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a _husband_ with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he **loses**.;1) [[rich_f](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f)] 19-7-2007(222): The _drop_ falling here is the _husband's_ toupee… he's already **lost** his hair once, now he's **losing** it again. Such is life, I suppose.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-8-2007(64): Note: Heisig's stroke order is wrong. It's the same as vermilion, drop first. _Homer_ **loses/drops** his wedding ring.
武;warrior;With a _quiver_ of _arrows_ set on one's back, the goal of the **warrior** depicted here is not to attack but merely to _stop_ the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history!;1) [[richcoop](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop)] 13-3-2008(208): ONE- ARROW can STOP a **warrior**.;2) [[RickN](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RickN)] 19-12-2007(81): A great **warrior** can _stop_ any 0pponent with _one arrow_.
判;judgment;_Half_ . . . _saber_.

Their only weapon is the _needle_ embedded in their _crotches_ , and they're quite adept at using them.
加;add;_Muscles_ . . . _mouth_. This is the only case in which the primitive for _muscle_ appears on the left, note should be taken of the fact in composing one's story.;1) [[bigspenderJ](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigspenderJ)] 29-3-2007(374): If you eat anymore, you will be **add** ing more カロries.

細;dainty;Thread . . . brains.;1) [[marydj](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj)] 3-11-2007(200): **Dainty** women would always rather work with thread than in a field.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 26-1-2008(118): _Spider- Man_ used to just be a **dainty** , _brainy_ nerd.
質;substance;Two axes . . . shells.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-2-2007(243): What is this **substance** on this _clam_? I've already broken 2 _axes_ on it! (Good **question** … 質問 ).;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 5-1-2008(85): Another keyword that I do not like by Heisig. 質 【しつ】 (n,n-suf) quality. Story: Your at a local ax dealer and you have TWO AXES which you are testing for QUALITY by trying to split CLAMS right down the opening. Picture yourself succeeding with one AX and then some weird **SUBSTANCE** comes out of the shell…eww (I don't like clams).
特;special;Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word **special** distinct from the character we met earlier for _specialty_ (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a **special** class all its own - like the sacred _cows_ of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the _cows_ should be placed on the sacred grounds of a _Buddhist temple_ in this kanji.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(200): Think of not **special** people, but **special** animals. The sacred Hindu _cows_ are **special** \- they can wander around the _temple_ without fear of becoming roast beef.;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(45): The Church Lady is traveling through Japan and notices with distaste a sacred _cow_ relieving itself inside a _Buddhist Temple_. "Well, isn't _that_ **special** ".
際;occasion;Pinnacle . . . ritual.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 26-6-2007(194): On occasian, _rituals_ are held at the very tip of _The Pinnacle_.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 4-9-2006(68): Many _rituals_ are practiced every day (blessing before meals, evening prayer, etc.) Only the _peak_ _rituals_ (wedding, Bar Mitzvah, etc.) qualify to be called an **occasion**.
路;path;Wooden leg . . . each.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 17-4-2007(223): When pirates try to hide, it's always easy to find them.

One with a rubber stopper at the end for absorbing shocks on paved **path** s, and one with a wide foot to distribute weight better on mud **path** s.
政;politics;To the many definitions for **politics** that already exist, this character offers yet another: _correct taskmastering_. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that **politics** has to do with _taskmastering_ , maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed _correctly_ if only the right candidate is given a chance.;1) [[nagisa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa)] 19-5-2007(219): Those involved in **politics** are always trying to elect the _correct_ _taskmaster_.;2) [[cosby](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby)] 16-7-2008(189): Insane political _correctness_ on the left, and facists _taskmasters_ on the right- thats **politics** in a nutshell right there.
告;revelation;Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts **revelation** through the _mouth_ of a _cow_ , suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence.;1) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 18-9-2007(412): The **revelation** makes the cow's mouth drop down, "Hamburgers are made of what?!".;2) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 6-9-2008(29): In ancient times, the words from a _primitive cow's mouth_ were considered a **REVELATION** because they were the "udder truth.".
例;example;Person . . . file.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-8-2006(118): Mr T shows the **example** to the kids, and stays in the file (at supermarket, …). “I pity da foo who does not follow my **example** !”.;2) [[Clint](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint)] 20-11-2008(79): When _Mr. T._ wants to make an **example** out of a group of people, he lines them up all single _file_ and knocks them all out with one punch!

貴;precious;Purse . . . shells.;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 16-6-2007(161): Frodo kept the **precious** in the purse but did a switch with some worthless shells when he went to sleep. Heres gollum opening the purse "ahhh my **precious** ssssss…..why you m **** _ ___** **!!!!!.;2) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 14-9-2007(131): Inside your _purse_ is all of your _money_ and your keys (き) etc. All of your **precious** valuables.
雪;snow;_Rain_ that undergoes a change so that it can be swept aside with a _broom_ is **snow**.;1) [[BigAmish](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish)] 15-8-2008(183): **SNOW** isn't all that different from _RAIN_ , except it can be removed with a _BROOM_ because it only forms in freezing temperatures.;2) [[nesert](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert)] 28-6-2010(53): Unlike _rain_ , **snow** can be swept away with a _broom_.
万;ten thousand;Japanese counts higher numbers in units of **ten thousand** , unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read "four **ten-thousands** " by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to _bind up_ a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for _one_ and _bound up_ naturally come to form **ten thousand**. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for _bound up_ in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together.;1) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 30-10-2007(249): I _bound_ **ten thousand** dollars together and hid it under the _floor_.;2) [[Sleepyhead](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sleepyhead)] 30-1-2009(87): IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!
能;ability;Try relating this kanji to that of the previous frame. For instance, you might imagine that the test of **ability** envisioned here is removing the _bear_ from the oven fire.;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 17-3-2008(246): The amputee has no hands but only stumps of _flesh_ beneath his _elbows_. To give him the **ability** to eat he has _two spoons_ implanted in his arm stumps, one in each side.;2) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 16-7-2007(57): Kid from the Oracle's place in the Matrix (whose head is shining like the moon) is holding a a spoon and making it bend using his special **ability**. When Neo asks to learn this **ability** the child replies, " Remember the truth Neo, there is no spoon." Neo Proceeds to the kitchen pondering these words of wisdom. The Child smiles mischeviously and pulls a second spoon hidden up his sleeve in the crook of his elbow. "That's right Neo," the child laughs, "there is no spoon…there are two spoons!".

片;one-sided;This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle.

Just cause he won the gold doesn't mean he can place himself on such a high **pedestal** and do whatever he wants!
去;gone;Soil . . . elbow.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 2-11-2007(385): "Going, going, **GONE**!", said the gravedigger as he shoveled _soil_ onto the body's protruding _elbow_ (the last bit left to cover).;2) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 9-4-2007(65): If you want the soil stains **gone** from your clothes, then you'll need to put some elbow grease into cleaning them.

But the **tea** plant itself has its own _flowers_ , which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the _tea_ , as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of _flowering_ **tea** bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g _wooden poles_ (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny _umbrella_ at the top to shade the delicate-tasting **tea** _flowers_.;1) [[wreckz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz)] 21-1-2008(214): Some people think drinking **tea** is boring and quaint.

止;stop;The character for **stop** is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it.

The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot.;1) [[brunosprak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brunosprak)] 6-1-2008(83): If you find in the _ground_ a _walking stick_ with a _magic wand_ , **STOP**!

[「幸せから一本取ると辛い」](midori://search?text=「幸せから一本取ると辛い」) – if you take but one stroke away from **happiness** , you get painfulness. (oh well, Heisig used similar one for 百 ).
角;angle;_Bound up_ . . . _glass canopy_ . . . _walking stick_ . . . _two_. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for _soil_ , which would prompt you to write it in improper order.;1) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 4-5-2007(203): A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an **angle**.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 29-12-2007(36): [+nuke] As a primitive, a boomerang. This boomerang is used to grab a bunch of meat, or _flesh_ , lying around on the ground at a farm. First, you throw it straight at a _walking stick_ , then it makes a right **angle** and goes to _walking stick_ number _two_ , and wraps around that. A quick tug, and you've got all the _flesh_ flying toward you contained in that tri **angle**. Hooray for free (stolen) food!

首;neck;Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: _horns_ . . . _nose_. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great _horns_ and long _nose_. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's  "head" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its **neck**. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word **neck** conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g **neck** hanging over the fireplace, whose _horns_ you use for a coat-rack and whose _nose_ has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for _horns_ : that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here.;1) [[bakamono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono)] 20-8-2007(130): The V shape is your **neck** on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. _Yourself_ , or the rest of your body is below that!;2) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 24-8-2006(96): The mooses **neck** supports it's big horns and long nose.
兄;elder brother;By now kanji like this one should "look like" something to you even though it is more of an "ideogram" than a "pictograph." The large _mouth_ on top and the _human legs_ below almost jump off the page as a caricature of **elder brother** , the one with the big _mouth_ (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who  "has the say" among all the children).;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(138): My **elder brother** was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 23-1-2008(22): The pac man's ( 只 ) **elder brother** has to have longer legs than his junior.

Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!
夢;dream;To have a **dream** after going to bed is really the _crown_ to a perfect _evening_. The _flower_ petals over the _eyes_ (instead of the  "sand" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant **dream** suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 13-11-2007(164): Last night's date with Miss Sweden was like a **dream**. She even laid _flowers_ over my _eyes_ to _crown_ the perfect _evening_.;2) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 27-3-2007(59): In the movie American Beauty, Kevin Spacey liked to **DREAM** about his daughter's friend and have a _rose petal_ fall onto his _eye_ from the _ceiling_.

Hrmph. No wonder it was so cheap…;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 7-5-2007(110): How to make snake **maki** : Take a _snake_.

寺;Buddhist temple;You have heard of people "attaching" themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a **Buddhist temple** with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused _land_ around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with _glue_ , steps down firmly, and so joins the **Buddhist temple** as a  "permanent member.";1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(179): At the **Buddhist temple** the monks are seated on the _ground_ , _glued_ there in meditation.;2) [[Murjab](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab)] 2-9-2007(45): To be allowed to join the **Buddhist temple** , imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the _soil_ for a long time in a _measurement_ of his resolve.

How about a samurai cow? He doesn't have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he's part of the _bushi_ **SYSTEM**. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen.

You travel to the _poles_ , a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is _decayed_ (see story for [decay](../v4/1243.html) (#1243 朽)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your _mouth_ as your lips turn blue, then your _crotch_ also gets cold as your body fails, finally you fall to the _floor_.

段;grade;The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for _staples_ with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke.

To the right, _missile_.;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 25-8-2007(268): This is a military- **grade** _staple gun_!

江;creek;Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the **creek** is often no more then a dribble of _water_ trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of _water_ is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how **creeks** are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of _water_ somewhere and dig a little path into dry land.

消;extinguish;Among the many things _water_ is useful for is **extinguishing** fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the _water_ at the left as the _drops of water_ that are used to depict _water_ in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to **extinguish** a fire would be to see that each _drop of water_ hits one _spark_ of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(127): To **extinguish** a SPARK, you need WATER.;2) [[zdnks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdnks)] 31-10-2007(55): You need a few drops of water to **extinguish** the candle.

Finally, I'm about to fight him. But what's this? He's suspiciously quiet. I move to attack him, and his right arm falls off at the _elbow_. Strange. I walk up to him and **detach** his left arm.

格;status;If you can imagine _trees_ as **status** symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then _each_ might be aiming to have his/her own _tree_ , just to keep up with the Suzukis.;1) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 13-6-2007(250): "Ranger!

Think of a mummy, and the key word will not be far behind.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-2-2007(225): Note: this is the ひさ in ひさしぶり . **Long time** no see _mummy_! (A bound up person).;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 2-3-2006(33): This is a picture of a person bowing "long time no see!".

旅;trip;Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for _garment_ , represent a _rag_ as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: _banner_ . . . _rag_.;1) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 4-12-2006(237): The boat starts to leave on it's **trip** across the Atlantic.

In fact, the japanese verb 続く is used in comics and tv shows to mean "to be **continue** d". They have adapted the model created by Spiderman to hook the readers so that they can sell more comics.

Get it? This one was hard until I came up with this.

(Pay special attention to the drawing of the first 3 strokes.);1) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 17-12-2007(148): **Warning:** The left part is NOT the primitive _turtle_! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!;2) [[shadolite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite)] 20-3-2008(122): In the **north** , the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.

[驚く＝おどろく](midori://search?text=驚く＝おどろく) = surprise. The Trojans stood in _awe_ of the magnificent Trojan Horse that they thought was a gift. But imagine their **surprise (wonder)** when a bunch of Greeks came rushing out of it! (To further cement the connection between the primitives, if needed: It's a **wonder** that the Trojans managed to speak _keigo_ 敬語 even then, saying " わたくしたちを殺さないでください !! お願い致します !!").
売;sell;A _samurai_ , out of a job, is going door-to-door **selling** little windup _crowns_ with _human legs_ that run around on the floor looking like headless monarchs.;1) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 4-4-2008(101): The _samurai_ happened to find an extra large _crown_ that he wore as a belt on his waist, just above his _legs_.

談;discuss;In almost every attempt to **discuss** an issue, the fervor of one's convictions comes to the surface and creates an _inflammation_ of _words_ (if you will, the  "cuss" in **discuss** ).;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 10-10-2007(218): Think of an online **discuss** ion group where misunderstanding someone's _words_ leads to _flaming_. An angry **discuss** ion = _inflamed_ _words_.;2) [[zardoz73](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73)] 3-8-2008(104): Internet **discuss** ions often involve inflammatory words. Flame war!

Distinguish from _fall_ (Frame 320) and _crash_ , which we considered in the previous frame.;1) [[wingedge](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge)] 22-12-2007(207): "Sunglasses-missing-one-lens" is obviously the _monocle_. The proper, high- class way to **descend** _The Pinnacle_ is wearing a _monocle_ with your _walking legs_ splayed to a full gentlemanly stride.;2) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 30-5-2007(33): After a cool, hip businessman angered the executives at _The Pinnacle_ , they beat him up, popping out a lens from his _sunglasses_ , and tossed out the window, head first, _walking legs_ second. One executive later commented, "It was like he was **descend** ing into Hell from Heaven!".
谷;valley;_Go in_ . . . _an umbrella_ . . . _a mouth_. Because of space restrictions, the element for _go in_ is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a **valley** stands out more clearly: the _mouth_ of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 21-2-2007(207): This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of **valley** : a **valley** _mouth_ open under the _umbrella_ of inner labia, with the outer labia _parted_ above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will _enter_ no further…;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 3-7-2006(81): Think of the classic anime 風の **谷** のナウシカ (Nausicaa of the _Valley_ of the Wind).

Picture a very weird bird that can imitate with its _mouth_ (a bird with mouth, heh) the voice of many different animals: Meeow! Woof! Mooo! Cuack!!! (Maybe the bird has Kirby powers and obtains the abilities of the animals it eats).
越;surpass;Here we see two _parades_ in competition, each trying to **surpass** the other by _running_ at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little  "hook" at the end of the first stroke of the element for _parade_. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book.;1) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 4-9-2007(223): The person in charge of _running_ the _parade_ **surpass** ed all our expectations (by just a extra drop…).;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 7-1-2008(102): The _parade_ of _runners_ are all trying to **SURPASS** each other - and they end up running all the way to _Vietnam_ (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).
静;quiet;_Blue_ . . . _contend_. Do not confuse with _calm_ (Frame 1230).;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 16-8-2006(201): When someone you know who is normally talkative goes **quiet** , it's usually a sign that they are _contending_ with the _blues_.;2) [[zz_alex_zz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz)] 24-3-2008(75): "And the next _contend_ er is…. a _Smurf_!" As you can imagine, the crowd goes **quiet** with shock.
押;push;_Fingers_ . . . _roots_. Compare and contrast with _pluck_ (Frame 1187).;1) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 2-10-2007(154): **Push** the _roots_ down, instead of plucking the seedling.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 4-3-2007(100): Use your _fingers_ to make sure the _roots_ of your plant are deep underground by **pushing** them down, down, down.
市;market;Dressed in nothing but a bath _towel_ and _top hat_ , one sets off to the **market** place in search of a bargain or two.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 14-10-2007(166): My recurring nightmare: Walking through the **market** , and suddenly realizing that I'm wearing only a top hat…and a towel.;2) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 13-7-2008(51): At the **MARKET** you find lots of nice TOP HATS and TOWELS.
走;run;**Running** , we are told here, _mends_ the _soil_. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for _road_ does, and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.;1) [[Samchan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan)] 4-8-2008(319): Hint: This kanji is NOT _soil_ on top of _mend_ , as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is _10_ on top of _mend_. So my story is: If you **run** _10_ miles, you will need to _mend_ your socks!;2) [[poseid0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/poseid0n)] 11-7-2007(33): The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been **RUN** NING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.
舞;dance;The top two strokes show someone _reclining_ , and the next six are a pictograph of an oaken _tub_ ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing. At the bottom, the _sunglasses_ round off the character.;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 16-6-2007(228): The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem **dance** s nakes for him.;2) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 15-6-2008(120): I learned [nothingness](../v4/1775.html) (#1775 無) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive **dance** rs should **dance** wearing **nothing** but **sunglasses**.
俺;myself;The key word refers to a very familiar way of referring to oneself, typically used by men. Its component elements: _person_ . . . _St. Bernard_ . . . _eel_.;1) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 11-12-2009(73): **Myself** as used by men – a _person_ who prides himself on how _big_ his “ _eel_ ” is.;2) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 16-9-2007(30): "I did it all by **myself**!" _Mr T_ stands there proud as holding a _moray eel_ in his hand. He's brought down terrorist organisations, drug syndicates, but gets all worked up when catching a fish… what a guy.
奴;guy;Woman . . . crotch.;1) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 26-2-2008(208): That **GUY** stole my WOMAN so I kicked him in the CROTCH.

Easy to recognize: he's the _person_ with the _elephant_ head.
象;elephant;A _rabbit_ 's head with the body of a _sow_ represents an **elephant**. Little wonder that the kanji also means  "phenomenon"!;1) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 14-10-2006(288): An **elephant** has huge ears, like a _rabbit_ , and a big, fat body, like a _sow_.;2) [[Transtic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic)] 7-3-2008(28): An animal with huge **ears like a rabbit** , and **a body fat like a pig** … ¡An **ELEPHANT**! For the "phenomenon" connotation you could use Dumbo, or Joseph Merrick (the "elephant man") ( <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick> ).
交;mingle;Top hat . . . father.;1) [[onsen_monkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey)] 6-9-2006(257): Even though your FATHER is an old man, he can't give up his party lifestyle. Once a week he still dons his cool TOP HAT (well, it was cool 40 years ago) and goes out on the town to **MINGLE** with the ladies.

But as we know, "heavenly" clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are "animal horns (first 3 strokes)" and "big/dog (last 3 strokes)." What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express.
至;climax;_Wall_ . . . _soil_.

詩;poem;Since silence is treasured so highly at a _Buddhist temple_ the _words_ spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like **poems**. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept **poem** and _recitation_ distinct in your mind.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 20-12-2006(188): A **poem** is a _temple_ of _words_.;2) [[kashikoi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kashikoi)] 14-1-2009(79): I'm saying this **poem** just for you, I built this temple from dirt and glue.

河;river;The character in this frame represents a step up from the _stream_ we met in Frame 134, it is a full-sized **river**.

Now I either think of the Little Engine that _could_ dragging a bunch of stuff down a **river** in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.

夕;evening;Just as the word **evening** adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word  "night," so the kanji for **evening** takes the ordinary looking _moon_ in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame).;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 13-2-2008(113): The **evening** is young, the _moon_ is not full.;2) [[ctalbottclark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctalbottclark)] 7-3-2008(33): In the **evening** , the crescent _moon_ hangs in the sky.

He is simply Wolverine and Raphael glued together back to back (the biggest assholes from both groups combined).
林;grove;Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A **grove** is a small cluster of _trees_.

己;self;The kanji carries the abstract sense of the **self** , the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a _snake_ \- which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, _oneself_ (frame 36) and _I_ (frame 17).;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 25-10-2005(255): This kanji looks like the "s" of "self", looking at its own reflection in a mirror (reversed sideways), as if pondering about his "self".;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 18-8-2007(90): When Superman looks at him **self** in the mirror, this is what he sees on his chest.

Imagine his shock when all he gets is a giant white bowl and just a single drop of **blood** in the centre and a drizzling of balsamic around the edge. Disgusted he calls the manager over tells him its overpriced tosh and bites into his neck with a huge gush of **blood** spraying everywhere.;2) [[genbaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku)] 17-1-2008(49): You cut yourself washing the dishes, drop of **blood**.

満;full;_Water_ . . . _flowers_ . . . _both_.

Thank you for asking! How kind! But no, I feel quite **full** now.
妙;exquisite;The primitive for _woman_ is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for _few_. When we refer to a _woman_ as **exquisite** , we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but _few_ and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word **exquisite** carries this same sense of  "seeking out" the rare from the ordinary.;1) [[amthomas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas)] 11-6-2007(305): **Exquisite** _women_ are _few_ and far between.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 27-1-2008(44): A geisha is an **exquisite** and **delicate** (another meaning of this kanji) women, however, even in the past there was only few of them.

(originally from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra - see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days>). I suspect Heisig chose "salad" as the name for the radical just for this phrase…

円;circle;This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it.

雲;cloud;Here is the full character for **cloud** from which the primitive for a _rising cloud_ derives. _Clouds_ begin with vapors _rising_ up in small _clouds_ from the surface of the earth, and then gathering to make **clouds** that eventually dump their _rain_ back on the earth.;1) [[roderik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roderik)] 22-4-2008(199): Every _rising **cloud**_ is a potential _rain_ **cloud**.

Stay tuned for this and more!".;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 25-4-2006(69): On the left we have baseball and wood, which obviously means a baseball bat. Instead of balls, there are **miscellaneous** other objects you may hit with it. While beating people may be one favorite use, in this case we see it used for making turkey mash.

肉;meat;Let this doubling of one of the elements for " _inside_ " yield the sense of " _insides_ " to approach the key word, **meat**. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of _flesh_ or _part of the body_ for the kanji 月.;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 13-1-2008(176): Here we are looking at an x-ray of a cannibal whose insides are full on people-meat.;2) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 19-9-2007(61): A _person's_ _inside_ \- fleshy, raw, pink, **meat**.
暮;livelihood;Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a _graveyard_ and spend your _days_ tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of **livelihood**.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(215): He made a **livelihood** out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.;2) [[Ryuujin27](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ryuujin27)] 31-12-2006(61): I like trikatu's simple way to remember this, but just in case the primitive placements confuse you, change it around to this: Before you complain about your **livelihood** , think about spending your days _under_ a graveyard. Life is always better than death, eh?
博;Dr.;At the left we have the _needle_ , at the right, the kanji for _specialty_ , plus an extra _drop_ at the top. Think of a **Dr.** who is a _specialist_ with a _needle_ (an acupuncturist) and let the _drop_ at the top represent the period at the end of **Dr.** In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions, but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-9-2007(307): _Ten specialties_ grants you the title of **Dr.** with a dot.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 29-7-2006(109): Watch for [doctor](../v4/1694.html) (#1694 医), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well "learned", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 ("doctor") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as "Dr. Who", "Dr. Jekyll", even "Dr. Dobb's" if you're into programming.
吹;blow;To **blow** is really no more than a deliberate effort to make one's _mouth lack_ all the air that is in it.;1) [[usis35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35)] 6-7-2008(281): This is clearly a **BLOW** JOB, we can see the MOUTH and the LACK OF condom. (I am sorry for the image, but it sticks forever in your mind).;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 21-1-2008(70): How am I supposed to **BLOW** if I _lack_ a _mouth_? (Imagine a kid at his own birthday party, and - like Neo in the Matrix - had no oriface where his mouth was to be. And yet, the people cruelly cheer him on to **blow** out his candles…).
更;grow late;The implication behind the meaning of **grow late** is that things are changing in the same way that the day turns into night. The elements: _ceiling_ . . . _sun_ . . . _tucked under the arm_.;1) [[perfecturbo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perfecturbo)] 28-6-2006(235): It's starting to **GROW LATE** , so God will take the SUN, and TUCK IT UNDER HIS ARM, and walk away. In the morning, he'll bring it back, so don't worry.;2) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 24-7-2007(106): At [nightbreak](../v4/30.html) (#30 旦) the sun rises above the floor, so it is logical that when it is growing late, the sun would rise to the ceiling. Time to pack up your things and take your belongings under your arm.
困;quandary;Pent in . . . trees.;1) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 17-10-2007(291): I'm supposed to make an enclosure for my _tree_ , but if I use its _wood_ for the enclosure, there won't be anything left to be _pent-in_. What a **quandary**!;2) [[pazustep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep)] 22-7-2008(64): Trees need space to grow. If you _pent in_ a _tree_ , it will be in quite a **quandary**!
派;faction;_Water_ . . . _drag_ . . . _rag_. Back in frame 1127 we indicated that this latter radical would come up once again, as it does in this and the following two frames.;1) [[revenantkioku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/revenantkioku)] 10-12-2007(321): Drag + rag gave me trouble until I came up with zombie for it. The zombie population became more diverse, separating into different **faction** s. One of them being the water Zombies.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 13-3-2007(48): The radical **faction** is almost eliminated, sir. They're living in the _sewers_ dressed in _rags_ and _dragging_ their supplies.
曲;bend;Picture yourself grabbing hold of the two strokes poking out the top of the kanji and wrenching them apart, thus giving the sense of **bend**. If you think of them as deriving from the element for _brains_ beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with **bending** someone's mind to your own point of view.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 28-10-2005(250): It looks like the mouth of _Bender the robot_ , from Matt Groening's animated series "Futurama". Thus, I use the character _Bender the robot_ as a primitive.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 5-9-2006(120): Also means "melody". Think of it as a pictogram of a guitar where you have to **bend** the strings to make a **melody**.
傍;bystander;Person . . . stand . . . crown . . . compass.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 30-4-2008(205): In Japan, the emperor is a **bystander** \- he _stands on his crown_ but can't really affect the _direction_ of the country. (thx shimouma).;2) [[the_marshal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal)] 6-3-2006(132): Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand… he's asking the **bystander** if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).
縁;affinity;Thread . . . broom . . . sow.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 19-4-2007(206): There once was a lonely little pig that constantly followed Spiderman, always nuzzling his leg and oinking tenderly. Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the _pig_ was to take a _broom_ and sweep up all of _Spiderman's leftover threads_ after having fought crime. The pig felt such **affinity** for Spiderman, he happily accepted—and did a good job too.;2) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 8-2-2008(159): Spiderman has no **affinity** for a broom hence his house is a pig sty.
橋;bridge;The **bridge** shown here is made of _trees_ in their natural form, except that the trunks have been carved into the forms of _angels_ , a sort of "Ponte degli Angeli.";1) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 27-7-2006(130): The nicest **bridge** is not in Holly _wood_ or Los _Angel_ es, but in San Francisco.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 30-10-2007(93): A small 5 year old child has lost her mother in a tragic death. Her family tells her, "Don't worry, your mom is an angel now, in heaven, watching over you." The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of wood. Her dad asks her, "What are you doing with that wood?" "I'm trying to build a **bridge** to heaven to visit the angels.".
興;entertain;_Mortar_ . . . _same_ . . . _tool_. Be careful to make an image that keeps _same_ in the middle.;1) [[laner36](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36)] 21-11-2007(202): To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be **entertain** ed. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the _same: staples_. What _tools_! [ayoung24].;2) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 27-8-2007(90): Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) – all this as a tool to **entertain** a group of drunks at a club.
附;affixed;Pinnacle . . . adhere.;1) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 12-6-2006(153): A sign was **AFFIXED** on the PINNACLE of the Acropolis so that tourists would ADHERE to the rules.;2) [[xentropic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xentropic)] 27-7-2008(68): Signs are **affixed** to walls in _The Pinnacle_ to ensure tourists _adhere_ to the rules.
里;ri;That's right - a **_ri_**. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary, it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One **_ri_** is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the _rice field_ , and below the element for _land_. Those four sections you see in the _rice field_ (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of _land_ , much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a "country mile." The _land_ division based on the size of a _rice field_ is called a **_ri_**.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(141): The **ri** is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a **RI** CE FIELD.;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(86): Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You'll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: **House of the Parents**.
並;row;This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for _stand up_. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-6-2007(290): This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of _two_ people _standing_ in a **row**.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 12-1-2006(53): Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a **row** ing boat. In a **row** ing boat people sit in **row** s, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for "rowboat" coming at frame 1876. The **row** ing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for "rowboat" has a generic meaning of "a small boat". In any case, the kanji for "rowboat" will not appear as a primitive in the book.
期;period;_Bushel basket_ . . . _month_. As the _month_ indicates, this has to do with **periods** of time.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 13-3-2007(195): The slowest remote chess game ever: a one _month_ **period** between every move.;2) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 5-4-2009(88): The slowest chess game ever: It took him a one _month_ **period** to move the _rook_! (Edited from dingomick).
米;rice;This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of **rice** lying on a plate in the shape of a star.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the **rice**. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 19-12-2007(52): Two _drops_ of **rice** in a _tree_ , simple.
毎;every;"Behind **every** successful person _lies_ a woman..., " who usually turns out to be one's _mama_!;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 4-1-2007(238): Freud believed **every** man wants to _lie down_ with his _mother_.;2) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 18-12-2007(60): Who does **every** person want to lie down with? Yo' MAMA!
抜;slip out;Fingers . . . friend.;1) [[rizzo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo)] 27-10-2005(297): Don't let good _friends_ **slip out** between your _fingers_.;2) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 19-5-2007(146): Imagine a cliché Hollywood situation: one person is lying on the edge of the abyss and another (presumably his _friend_ ) is hanging, only thing holding him is the grip of their hands. Then _fingers_ **slip out** of the grip and he falls in said abyss.
岸;beach;Mountain . . . cliff . . . dry.;1) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 4-11-2006(255): At the base of _mountain_ _cliff_ s, there is usually a **beach**. You often can see people lying there, _drying_ off after a swim.;2) [[Pete171](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171)] 17-11-2008(91): Three impossibilities for a **beach** : There cannot be a **beach** at the top of a _mountain_. There cannot be a **beach** on the top of a _cliff_. There cannot be a **beach** that is completely _dry_.
吾;I;There are actually a number of kanji for the word **I** , but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the "perceiving subject." Now the one place in our bodies that all _five_ senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than _five mouths_ : 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, _five mouths_ = **I**.;1) [[kbaum](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kbaum)] 18-7-2007(170): I have 5 senses.;2) [[AxelFoe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AxelFoe)] 12-11-2007(139): I eat five times at day.
求;request;Let the _drop_ in the upper right-hand corner of this character close the right angle off to make an _arrowhead_. Whenever we find the _needle_ with that _drop_ in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning. At the bottom, we see the _grains of rice_ , the vertical line doubling up for the two elements. Do not confuse with _petition_ (Frame 143).;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 16-6-2007(221): Enemy: "Any final **request** s?" // MacGyver: "Just an _arrowhead_ and some _grains of rice_." (MacGyver then throws the _grains of rice_ at the enemy and uses the _arrowhead_ to cut his hands free from the rope.).;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 22-8-2007(134): _Robin Hood_ holds his rich victim at _arrowpoint_ and kindly **request** s that he hands over his _grains of rice_.
労;labor;Schoolhouse . . . power.;1) [[partyrash](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/partyrash)] 15-1-2008(343): Those jocks who always tried to show their muscles in the schoolhouse are now the ones out there doing manual **labor** jobs while we sit here and learn Japanese. Ha!;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 13-5-2007(92): At the _schoolhouse_ , the administration develops the children's _muscles_ by making them do manual **labour**.
薄;dilute;Take a good look at this kanji: the "strong" element here is really the _flower_ , not the _water_ as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the _acupuncturist_ from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote **diluting** the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our _acupuncturist_ performing his task with _flowers_ in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe _water_ into the body of the patient.;1) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 17-10-2007(173): A _Dr._ missing his needle can only use **dilute** _flower water_ for medicine.;2) [[pm215](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215)] 15-2-2008(112): [As suggested by stehr and on the forum (<http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079>), we create a new keyword 'seaweed' for the _flower_ on top and _water_ below and to the left. See also [fall](../v4/299.html) (#299 落), [clan](../v4/1912.html) (#1912 藩),[seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). This story is for people using that idea.] The _homeopath_ (a doctor without any needle) specialises in **dilute** medicines. This one's an essence of _seaweed_ – just dip the seaweed into the beaker, swish it about and remove. Barmy!
黙;silence;Oddly enough, the character for **silence** shows us a _black chihuahua_. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about **silence** that begins,  "Hello, Darkness, my old friend...." Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 25-10-2006(366): The _computer_ won't stop beeping, which is making the _chihauhua_ bark, and it's driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the _fire_ and finally enjoy the **silence**.;2) [[Wakela](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela)] 23-3-2007(56): Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally, **silence** in the neighborhood.
劇;drama;Tiger . . . sow . . . saber.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 16-3-2007(245): A great Indian **drama** acted out every year is how a poor Bengali boy fended off the _tigers_ from his _pigs_ using only a _sabre_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 2-11-2007(48): If you thought "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" was full of **drama** then you'll love "The _Tiger_ the _Sow_ and the _Sword_ ".
端;edge;Vase . . . mountain . . . comb.;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 12-2-2006(248): Have you ever seen those shots in movies where the hero is _standing_ at the _edge_ of a sheer _mountain_ face, hair blowing in the wind? It probably wouldn't seem so heroic if you saw him ten minutes earlier, when a crew of stylists was carefully _combing_ his hair so it would fall perfectly.;2) [[eltjopoort](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort)] 12-7-2008(112): When you _stand_ a _comb_ on its **edge** , it looks like the [mountain](../v4/768.html) (#768 山) kanji.
確;assurance;On the left you see the _rock_ , which is familiar enough. But pay attention to the right. Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the "chimney" on the _house_ doubled up with the first stroke of the _turkey_ , we may see the right side as a _turkey house_ (or  " _coop_ "). We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive.;1) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 30-8-2007(260): To assure that no one will get into the Turkey coop, put a huge rock in the entrance!;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 5-12-2008(129): You've heard the expression "killing two birds with one stone." ( 一石二鳥 _is-seki-ni- chou_ ). We'll, there's another one that roughly translates as "killing an entire coop with a giant boulder. " That's the method that hunters use when they want absolute **assurance** of taking home a bird.
単;simple;_Owl_ . . . _brain_ . . . _needle_. The sense is  "not complex.";1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 20-12-2006(208): Owls are smart…for this _owl_ everything is **simple** coz his _brain_ is _ten_ times more powerful than mine.;2) [[nekoyaki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nekoyaki)] 8-6-2009(31): For _owl_ s, finding a _needle_ in a _rice field_ is **simple** (much better eyesight than us humans).
末;extremity;This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the **extremity** of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.;1) [[amema](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amema)] 20-11-2007(108): The tree has reached the **extremity** of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.;2) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 8-4-2008(30): There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let's try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his **extremity** into a small hole in a _tree_.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the **extremity**? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I'd prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ,).
弟;younger brother;Horns . . . dollar sign.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 6-10-2007(216): **Younger brothers** are always more prone to mischief. Mine, you can almost see the little _horns_ on him and the _dollar signs_ on his eyes when he comes up with a money-making scheme.;2) [[taijuando](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando)] 29-1-2007(67): The **younger brother** was a _horny_ _dollar_ -chasing bastard.
具;tool;Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's **tools** of all sorts, each equipped with its own _eye_ so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.;1) [[Rinifett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett)] 25-9-2007(200): Keep an eye on your **tool** s while you work at the table.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-8-2007(107): One **tool** nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.
絵;picture;Thread . . . meeting.;1) [[PacifistGod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod)] 30-7-2007(368): There's never a **picture** of Spiderman meeting Peter Parker… I wonder why?;2) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 8-11-2007(51): Peter Parker's editor tells him "Next time you have a _meeting_ with _spiderman_ take a goddamn **picture** , you're a photographer after all".
裏;back;An innocent looking _top hat and scarf_ lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden _computer_ sewn into the **back** of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such experiences teach one always to have a look at the **back** side of things.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 9-1-2006(248): The _computer_ had carefully dressed up in _clothes_ to look human. It was n't until I looked at the **back** and saw the cables and stuff that I realized what it was.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 15-6-2008(178): Can computers be gay? I'm not sure, but mine always wears a top hat and scarf, and for some reason its **back** door port is always open…
改;reformation;Pluralizing the _snake_ and focusing on a single _taskmaster_ may help recommend the image of Ireland's most famous **reformer** , St. Patrick, who, legend has it, drove away the _snakes_ from the land.;1) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 8-1-2008(167): The _taskmaster_ of Slytherin ( wizardry house symbolized by a _snake_ ) plans a **reformation** of Hogwarts, disallowing the study of magic to all muggle- born. こわいですね！.;2) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 4-6-2008(110): If you want to achieve the **reformation** of your _inner self_ you have to control your desires and correct your flaws, in sum, be your own _self taskmaster_.
冷;cool;Ice . . . orders.;1) [[samueruht](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht)] 31-1-2008(262): To keep your water **cool** , just _order_ some _ice_.;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 30-6-2007(67): The Japanese boss gives an _order_ at the meeting: eat _ice_ to stay **cool** (since they won't be running the air conditioning anymore).
及;reach out;The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched _fist_ into the kanji for **reaching out** , much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance.;1) [[Killersquierl](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Killersquierl)] 22-11-2007(103): I like to think of this as a _fist_ with with brass knuckles because of the extra line.

辺;environs;To keep the **environs** clean and safe, you could cement _daggers_  in the _road_ , blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 18-4-2007(205): Caution: this kanji doesn't mean environment, it means "environs, boundary, border, vicinity". To separate the **environs** , create the border by placing _daggers_ on the _road_.;2) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 19-1-2009(122): To protect the **environs** around their village, samurai would travel the _road_ s with their _swords_.
殿;Mr.;Flags . . . strung together . . . missile.;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 9-8-2007(170): **Mr.** President! We all stand here _together_ under a national _flag_. One thing is certain: we'll never give in. We are launching nuclear _missiles_ now to implement mutually assured destruction protocol.;2) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 2-10-2007(83): (+synewave) Noah looks on in disbelief as **Mr.** and Mrs. Smith board the _Ark_ , start waving their _flag_ everywhere and blasting everything in sight with a _missile launcher_.
抱;embrace;Fingers . . . wrap.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 28-4-2006(214): When embracing someone, wrap your fingers around her butt for added effect. You may think of "bound with snakes" as a description of the fingers slithering around the buttocks, if you want a particularly graphic image.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 3-10-2007(64): Here, I'm picturing that scene from ET (the extra terrestrial), where ET hugs Elliot before leaving. You see that **EMBRACE** is ET's long FINGERS that WRAP around Elliot.
状;status quo;Did you ever hear of the _turtle_ who fell madly in love with a _chihuahua_ but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the **status quo** with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.;1) [[tomtosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh)] 31-7-2007(161): It was _left_ to the **turtle** to make _right_ with the **dog** and thus maintain the **status quo.**.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 13-12-2006(91): A _turtle_ mounting a _chihuahua_ clearly disrupts the **status quo**.

At the end of the **evaluation** period the CD turns into a _lily_ pad so you can't use it any more (an innovative new copy- protection trick).
刻;engrave;Acorn . . . saber.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-4-2008(199): This famous ninja (I always use ninjas with _sabres_ , distinct from samurai) used to **engrave** the kanji for his name onto _acorns_ , and throw the _acorns_ to distract his enemies.

(Oh, and if you forget your hanko, I **doubt** they’ll let you in).

Well I wasn't strong enough to stay up on it and so fell over and have the **pain** to prove my mum right.
破;rend;Rock . . . pelt.;1) [[johnskb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb)] 13-6-2006(294): Before the invention of scissors or knives, sharp STONES were used to **REND** PELTs, so that caveman designers could complete new styles for the upcoming year.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 21-2-2007(80): **Rend** is a violent, primitive kind of word.

案;plan;Without much effort, the elements _relax_ . . . _tree_ suggest a hammock strung between two _trees_ in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, **planning** something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best **plan** of action to take. Be sure to relate the _relaxation_ to the _tree_ , so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like "legs" or "desk" or "table").;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(250): I **plan** to RELAX on top of that TREE.;2) [[MichaelAnd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd)] 15-4-2008(189): If you bring a woman to your house, generally its not a good **plan** to stick your wood up her bottom, she may scream in pain あん!

族;tribe;Banner . . . dart.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 12-3-2007(284): With a _banner_ declaring "Keep Out!" and blow _darts_ to back it up, the Amazon **tribe** is not that friendly.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 20-12-2006(45): Once **tribe** s shot _darts_ under their war _banners_ , now they are putting _banner_ ads on the internet for betting on _dart_ -games at their casinos :(.
争;contend;Bound up . . . rake.;1) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-1-2008(174): This can be seen as a Retarius, a roman gladiator. The Retiarius always fought with a net to _bound up_ his opponents, and with a _trident_ , which was able to pierce enemies after tying them. They were terrific **contenders** , so they were only paired with gladiators specially equipped to fight them.;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 21-6-2007(93): A boxing ring is _bound up_ by the ropes. The **contend** er is cheating and using a _rake_.
丸;round;We speak of " **round** numbers, " or " **rounding** a number off, " meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest _drop_ , to _nine_ , you end up with a **round** number.;1) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 20-6-2006(235): Nine plus a drop **round** s it off to ten!;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 16-8-2007(97): Watch out for [plump](../v4/120.html) (#120 太). Here Heisig could have added a "t" and we would have had a much better keyword : **rotund**. **Rotund** is more specific than "round" which begs for confusion with [circle](../v4/1811.html) (#1811 円). A dictionary search on "fat" or "round" doesn't yield this kanji, but "rotund" does! Primitive suggestion: the _Laughing Buddha_ is often depicted as a **rotund** , smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).
緒;thong;_Thread_ . . . _puppet_. Although we usually think of a **thong** as coming at the end of a piece of string, this character's meaning allows for it to come at the beginning as well.;1) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 8-11-2007(195): _Spiderman_ has a secret fetish, he likes nothing better than to dress his _lovedoll_ in a **thong**. Wierd, eh!;2) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 18-3-2009(44): A **thong** is no more than a _thread_ used by _someone_ as underwear!
句;phrase;By combining the two primitives _bound up_ and _mouth_ , we can easily see how this character can get the meaning of a **phrase**. After all, a **phrase** is nothing more than a number of words _bound up_ tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your _mouth_.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 31-10-2007(144): Some Japanese **phrase** s are difficult to _wrap_ your _mouth_ around.;2) [[shadolite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite)] 25-12-2007(118): A bound mouth cannot utter a single **phrase**.
銀;silver;Metal . . . silver.;1) [[Pauline](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline)] 3-7-2007(165): Like _gold_ , _silver_ is a _metal_.;2) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 23-1-2008(52): Not sure why Heisig find the right side so troublesome. My grandma's _hairpin_ (just before [long](../v4/1920.html) (#1920 長)) is made of **silver** , the metal that best reflects _sun_ light. I'm sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day. Note that the two elements ( _sun_ and _hairpin_ ) share not only a horizontal stroke, but also the left vertical one. Therefore a bit odd stroke order.
未;not yet;As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a _tree_ that is **not yet** fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the _tree_ has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the _tree_.;1) [[dat5h](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h)] 15-11-2008(148): I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) does **not yet** ( 未 ) have exremities ( 末 ) of vermilion ( 朱 ).;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 16-10-2007(64): [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is **not yet** ( 末 ) vermilion ( 朱 ).
軽;lightly;Car . . . spool.;1) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 25-2-2007(167): Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called **light** vehicles here. Imagine a so-called **light** vehicle or a **light** -truck with a load of _spools_ driving down a road ever so **lightly** , careful not to let any of the _spools_ roll out onto the street.;2) [[paddy71](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paddy71)] 2-2-2008(119): I want to tread **lightly** on the environment…. That's why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday…. I know, lame.
版;printing block;Although this character also carries the sense of an "edition" of a publication, the elements, _one-sided_ and _anti-_ , more readily suggest its other meaning of a **printing block**.;1) [[wrightak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak)] 3-9-2006(297): Before the advent of printers in Japan, typewriters couldn't be built as they were in the west due to how many kanji there are. Lots of small **printing block** s had to be used instead. _One side_ of the **printing block** would have a mirrored ( _anti_ ) image of the kanji. This is true.;2) [[matsuyamakiwi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi)] 7-6-2008(71): Nazi propaganda. Picture the **printing blocks** producing very _one-sided_ (Aryan), _anti_ -Jewish propaganda spreading posters to hang around town.
堂;hall;Outhouse . . . land.;1) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 7-11-2007(173): In most communities you will be hauled into city **hall** if you use the _ground_ as an _outhouse_.;2) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 4-4-2008(102): There is a secret **hall** buried in the _soil_ underneath the _outhouse_.
福;blessing;Altar . . . wealth.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 15-1-2007(224): This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave _wealth_ to the _altar_ (i.e. priest) and received a _blessing_. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation ( _wealth_ ) that is expected when you're called to the ark ( _altar_ in the kanji) to give a **blessing** over the torah.;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 19-6-2007(78): Put all your _wealth_ on the church _altar_ and receive one **blessing**. (You stand up out of your wheelchair or something.).
認;acknowledge;Words . . . endure.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 11-10-2005(183): You are given a _speech_ about some serious mistakes of yours, and you have to _endure_ the whole thing, because all you can do is **acknowledge**.;2) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 11-6-2006(142): I never read the "acknowledgements" section of books or theses, because they are mostly just boring _words_ that i must _endure_ reading, before i can get to the interesting part. :).
恋;romance;Apple . . . heart.;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 12-9-2007(192): The **romance** between Snow White and Prince Charming started when Snow White took a bite of poison _apple_ and her _heart_ stopped.;2) [[kodama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodama)] 1-11-2007(94): A childhood **romance** : a boy takes a _red apple_ to school to try to win the _heart_ of his beloved.
比;compare;With _two spoons_ , one in each hand, you are **comparing** your mother's cooking with your mother-in-law's.;1) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 13-10-2008(169): **Compare** the two spoons… the one on the left is funny-looking.;2) [[gpetroce](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gpetroce)] 9-6-2007(160): A gay couple about to turn around to **compare** which role is better…
建;build;To construct a **building** , you first draw a set of plans (the writing _brush_ ) and then _s-t-r-e-t-c-h_ your drawing out to scale in reality.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 12-9-2007(151): **Build** is easy to remember if you can remember that archtiechts have two steps in **build** ing. 1. Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it's just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients.;2) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 16-3-2008(95): A construction worker's classic morning. _Stretch, brush_ his teeth, and then start to **build**.
衆;masses;Blood . . . drag . . . rag.;1) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 5-3-2008(217): **Masses** of zombies, splattered with blood. (any zombie movie).;2) [[volfy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy)] 15-5-2006(43): The stroke order is tricky. Draw the first two strokes of _rag_ and then draw _drag_ and then the last two strokes of _rag_ , or at least so says WWWJDIC.
毛;fur;This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of _hand_ to produce **fur**. If you reverse your _hand_ and put its palm down, you will have the side on which **fur** grows.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 28-12-2006(179): I've heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous! That's not hair, that's **fur**!;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 31-7-2008(63): Be careful not to pet a cat the wrong way - most cats don't like you rubbing your _hand backwards_ over their **fur**.

腰;loins;Part of the body . . . need.;1) [[wrightak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak)] 27-6-2006(217): If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰 (こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say [腰がいたい！](midori://search?text=腰がいたい！) It's the _part of the body_ that _needs_ massaging.;2) [[Meconium](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium)] 18-5-2009(202): To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword 'loins' because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to- remember story. Just because you're all sexually repressed doesn't mean other people won't benefit from a story such as "the _part of the body_ people _need_ more than any other are the **loins** ".
快;cheerful;State of mind . . . guillotine.;1) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 5-2-2007(186): A large crowd in a **cheerful** _state of mind_ applaude each criminal as they become victims of the _guillotine_.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 9-9-2007(42): A **cheerful** crowd of insulted aliens applaude as _Data_ 's head is chopped off by _guillotine_.

So, the FIRE in the OLD WEST can tell people we're you're at, so put out the FIRE with SOIL to keep the **SMOKE** to a minimum.
敵;enemy;Picture your most precious _antique_ (it doesn't matter how old it really is, so long as it is the oldest thing YOU own) being knocked over by your most unlikeable _taskmaster_ , and you have a good picture of how people make themselves **enemies** for life.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 15-10-2007(173): The _taskmaster_ became my **enemy** for life when he smashed the _antique vase_ holding my wife's ashes.;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 28-1-2008(31): For us Miami Cubans, that _antique taskmaster_ (Fidel) is the **enemy**.
負;defeat;Above we have the condensed form of _bound up_ , and below the familiar _shellfish_. Now imagine two _oysters_ engaged in _shell_ -to- _shell_ combat, the one who is **defeated** being _bound and gagged_ with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The _bound shellfish_ thus becomes the symbol for **defeat**.;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 23-1-2008(219): _Tied up_ , the _shellfish_ had to accept **defeat**!;2) [[koldbein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koldbein)] 17-2-2009(29): The _shellfish_ admitted **defeat** when they placed a _hook_ on top of his head.

In 4 cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) _crown_ is above _human legs_ , and in the other 3 (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. I call the 1st pattern " _Miss World_ " (who is wearing a _crown_ & has long _human legs_ ) and the 2nd " _garter_ " (one _human leg_ passes through the _crown_ wearing it as a _garter_ ). Story: _Miss World_ has climbed a _tree_ to avoid the _finger_ that was **groping** for her. ( 探 means "grope for", i.e. search).
玉;jewel;Note the _drop_ here in the king's _scepter_ , which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious **jewel** handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.;1) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 24-4-2007(200): The king is said to have only one family **jewel** below the belt…;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 20-1-2008(36): The king is said to have only one family **jewel** below the belt…and he hangs left!

Think snowball effect, even if it wouldn't work with rocks.

Be sure not to forget that final dot in the element for _march_.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 9-1-2007(290): Santa had to put his _foot_ down to stop a _march_ of _little_ guys, namely elves.

伊;Italy;Used chiefly in proper names, and given the sound "i," this kanji can be remembered as an abbreviation of **Italy** , for which it is still used today in Japan. Its primitives: _person_ . . . _mop_.;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 11-9-2007(150): The "boot" of **Italy** has gotten Europe all muddy.

He grabs a monkey by the tail and neck, stretches him out a few times, then blows him up like a balloon. The monkey **EXPAND** s until it pops. Haha, sucka monkey, I pity you foo.
応;apply;_Cave_ . . . _heart_. The sense of the key word here is of something appropriate that fills a particular need, and hence  " **applies**. ";1) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 12-12-2006(182): [bravo, scottamus!] To **apply** for the job as a (replacement) Batman, you have to make it to the _heart of the cave_ past all the traps he set up to test you. There, you see a table with the application form on it. Now that you think about it, the ad in the paper did say "Those who don't make it to the _heart of the cave_ need not **apply**.".;2) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 17-10-2006(152): In the videogame Zelda, Link enters a CAVE to visit a fairy that will **APPLY** magic to fill his HEART containers.
団;group;Glued . . . pent in.;1) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 27-9-2007(241): When you are admitted into a **group** like the Yakuza, you're well and truly done (だん) for.

歴;curriculum;That same _grove of trees_ we met in frame 226 shows up here in the character for **curriculum** (in the sense of a record of one's life or academic achievements, the **curriculum** vitae). Instead of the _grove_ making its way slowly through the surface of the _cliff_ as before, here we see it _stopped_ , much the same as a **curriculum** vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 25-2-2008(314): A **CURRICULUM** is a _calendar_ that replaces days with reasons to _stop_ having fun.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 19-1-2007(96): A little like a _calendar_ , your **CV** records your _footsteps_ through time.
員;employee;How do we get a _mouth_ over a _shellfish_ to mean an **employee**? Simple. Just remember the advice new **employees** get about keeping their _mouths_ shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with _clams_ pinched to their _mouths_.;1) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 12-4-2008(119): An **employee** ( **member** of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job!;2) [[seshiiru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seshiiru)] 13-12-2007(57): An **employee** is basically a shellfish with a mouth.

衣;garment;At the top we see the _top hat_ , and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a **garment**.

微;delicate;Line . . . mountain . . . ceiling . . . human legs . . . taskmaster.;1) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 14-7-2007(111): The Column of 300 spartans were in a **delicate** situation. They had travelled in one line (using only their legs) to the mountain pass to face the fierce Persian task master.;2) [[cingold](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold)] 18-9-2009(74): We're _going_ up the _mountain_ announces the _taskmaster_.

Before the advent of paper (which the Chinese invented), writing was also done on segments of bamboo.

源;source;With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see _water_ and _meadow_ in this character for **source**. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word  "surge") and in popular usage, **source** suggests the place _water_ comes from. In this kanji, it is under the _meadow_ , where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little _springs_.;1) [[dogen2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2)] 17-3-2007(146): The _water_ that flows from the _meadow_ is the **source** of life for the wild antelope.;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 14-8-2006(74): The **source** of clean _water_ is from the [meadow](../v4/134.html) (#134 原): it comes from that _spring_ at the bottom of the _cliff_.

昨;yesterday;Day . . . saw.;1) [[kyldyyr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyldyyr)] 15-11-2005(185): One can use a simple word play to remember this character - the _day_ that I _saw_ before today was **yesterday**.;2) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 15-11-2006(127): Yester- DAY, all my troubles seemed SAW far away…
羽;feathers;From the pictograph of two bird-wings, we get **feathers**.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(94): Pictograph. Easy enough.;2) [[Ceryn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn)] 23-4-2008(63): These days the biggest concern in airline safety is ICE on the WINGS of the plane. Birds that fly long distances also have to worry about getting ICE on their **FEATHERS**.
宗;religion;House . . . altar.;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 9-9-2007(173): I never really did figure out what **religion** my host family was - all I knew was that they kept an _altar_ in their _home_.;2) [[Transtic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic)] 30-1-2008(108): All the **RELIGION** S have their own temples, which are **houses** where they place their **altars**.

眺;stare;To give someone the "evil _eye_ " is to **stare** at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being **stared** at is depicted as an _eye_ that _portends_ evil.;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 11-1-2006(140): Sauron's One fiery eye **stare** at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 13-11-2007(62): People **stare** d, _eyes_ wide, at the girl in the bathing suit - she had extremely _hairy legs_!
転;revolve;As the wheels of the _car_ **revolve** , they kick up small _rising clouds_ of dust and debris behind them.;1) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 5-3-2007(153): The REVOLVING wheels of the car (with **REVOLVE** R blaring on the stereo) kicked up RISING CLOUDS of dust.;2) [[komodo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo)] 20-6-2008(125): Just a note to remember the _cloud_ primative: The name of Goku's pet _cloud_ that he used to help him rise (fly) in the Dragonball anime series (and also the scientific name for a certain type of cloud) is _Nimbus_ [ <http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/dbztlog/screen2.jpg> ]. The katakana- ization of this is **ニム** バス, so the _rising cloud_ primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.
商;make a deal;See the peddlar _standing_ atop his _motorcycle helmet_ as if it were a soapbox, hawking his wares to passersby. The _legs_ and _mouth_ represent the tools of the trade of **making a deal** any way you can.;1) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 21-2-2007(327): I use what I think is the real etymology for this kanji which is so shocking it sticks. The STANDING member at the top is a certain part of the body that all men have and it is approaching the HOLE between TWO LEGS (the HOOD) with extra marks to show they are FLESHY - ie a womans legs. So this shows the oldest DEAL of all time - prostitution.;2) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 21-3-2006(86): Slick Willy standing on the motorcycle helmet he's trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is. His legs crash through the top of it and after a moment of awkward silence his mouth opens and says, "hey, we can still **make a deal**.".
州;state;Here we see _drops of_ land (little islets) rising up out of a _stream_ , creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the **state** -line is drawn between **states** separated by a river? If there were little _drops of_ land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(202): There were 3 little islands in the _stream_ who all decided to set themselves up as independent **states**.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 29-3-2008(28): シュウ The original meaning of this character was "sandbar", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American **state** s. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by **state** after **state** as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.
投;throw;Fingers . . . missile.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 6-2-2007(174): Well, you usually use your _fingers_ to **throw** objects used as _missile_ weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the _missile_ primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it's a _crotch_ (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the _wind_. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers…;2) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 11-8-2009(169): **If you use the primitive "semen" (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story**.
願;petition;A _meadow_ and a _head_ are all we are given to work with in the kanji for **petition**. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz _head_ located in the middle of the flowery _meadow_ we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, **petitioning** for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?);1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(310): Let's **petition** to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 9-11-2007(107): Japanese hippies **PETITION** to save a _meadow_ by getting people on the street to sign their _page_ \- as you pass by they call out: " [お願いします、おねがいします。”](midori://search?text=お願いします、おねがいします。”) .
研;polish;Stone . . . two hands.;1) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 15-5-2007(218): My _stones_ are so huge that it takes _two hands_ to **polish** them!;2) [[PacifistGod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod)] 30-1-2007(184): You use two hands to **polish** a stone: one to hold it and the other to rub it.
永;eternity;This kanji also uses the full form of _water_ , though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with _water_. Remember what William Blake said about seeing  "infinity in a grain of sand and **eternity** in an hour "? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see " **eternity** in a _drop of water_. ";1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 7-9-2007(177): It would take an **eternity** to count all the drops of water.;2) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 3-8-2007(50): It takes but one _drop_ from the most special _water_ : the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an **eternity**. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).
介;jammed in;The idea of something getting **jammed into** something else is depicted here by having a _walking stick_ get **jammed into** an _umbrella_ frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the _umbrella_ stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight _walking stick_. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.;1) [[LucidFaia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia)] 9-4-2008(194): The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for "jammed in.".;2) [[alkulp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alkulp)] 29-10-2007(63): Two people **jammed in** under an **umbrella**. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It's always me that ends up getting wet…. but the tail of the skirt is this time!
留;detain;Receipt . . . dagger . . . rice field.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 1-3-2007(322): Got a _receipt_ for that _dagger_ , son? If not, we're going to **detain** you and send you to work in the _rice fields_.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 8-11-2007(89): The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with **DETAIN**. Here the RANSOM NOTE says that the girl has been **DETAIN** ED in an undisclosed location. To get her back take the RANSOM to a empty FIELD.
雄;male;_By one's side_ . . . _elbow_ . . . _turkey_. Its match is in frame 605.;1) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 11-3-2008(298): Men walk with their _elbows_ out from their _sides_ in a weird _turkey_ trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70's pimp walk.;2) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 15-4-2007(94): **Masculine** duties are to offer your _elbow_ to the lady _by your left side_ and to cut the _turkey_ on special meals.
優;tenderness;Person . . . melancholy.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 23-8-2007(126): The _A-Team_ is on a mission to help _Hamlet_. With uncharacteristic **tenderness** , _Mr. T_ consoles the _melancholy Hamlet_. "No, I really DO pity the poor foo. There, there little guy…take my hanky". (Careful: [benevolence](../v4/885.html) (#885 徳).;2) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 15-10-2007(71): Someone can't be _melancholy_ for long if just one _person_ treats them with a little **tenderness**.
佐;assistant;Person . . . left.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 27-11-2008(177): Mr T's **assistant** is on his left. Why? Because Mr T has this bad habit of suddenly extending his right arm (what with all the boxing that he did), and his **assistant** got inadvertently punched in the face more than once (ouch). So now his **assistant** is always to his left side, much safer - "Stay on my _left_ , foo!".;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 9-5-2007(84): On your right is your "right-hand man" that you credit for all your success….on the left…… is your **assistant** who does all the grunt work and gets no credit for anything…
器;utensil;The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy _St. Bernard dog_ stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty _mouth_ , waiting for the **utensils** to arrive so the feast can begin.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 2-9-2007(184): Imagine four hungry _mouths_ all sitting around the table.

And 食器 means eating **utensil** s ("food container", hehe).
証;evidence;_Words_ that testify to the _correctness_ of some fact are classified as **evidence**.

回;-times;The suffix " **-times** " refers to a number of repetitions. Its elements: _a mouth_  . . . _pent in_. Hint: you may find it more helpful to forget the primitives and think of one circle revovling inside of another.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 16-2-2008(167): Write _mouth_ two **-times**.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 21-10-2005(73): Pretty much a pictograph, see book.

鹿;deer;Drawn on the walls of a complex of _caves_ near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of **deer** , some of them showing men in **deer** masks. By _comparing_ their drawings to real **deer** , Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt, and by _comparing_ themselves to the **deer** , to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a "double- _key_ " (the extra stroke through the element for _key_ ) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which _caves_ , a double- _key_ , and _comparing_ gives us the kanji for **deer**.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 1-5-2007(300): _Bambi_ wanders into a _cave_ and sees a _side order of salad_ and _2 spoons_ …but what's the main course?;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 26-4-2007(37): Santa's rein **deer** , Rudolf, opens a nightclub in a _cave_. It's popular with all the **deer** and rein **deer** in the world. The _cave_ speciality is a _salad w/ dressing on the side_. There is no other **deer** club that can _compare_. How many other **deer** nightclubs are there?
仏;Buddha;Person . . . elbow.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 4-2-2007(143): _Mr. T_ says, "I ain't afraid o' no foo!

If a particular style is trendy, soon they all want their own _hair_ in the same _shape_ as that of their _friends_.;2) [[kodama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodama)] 8-11-2007(49): _Friends_ influence the _length_ and _shape_ of each other's **hair**.
致;doth;The archaic English form for "does" indicates a humble form of the verb "to do." It is made up of _climax_ and _taskmaster_.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 12-6-2008(267): This character is used in two very high-frequency words: "you are welcome" ( どう致しまして ) and the honorific form of onegaishimasu ( お願い致します , おねがいいたします). Can't you just picture this ridiculously polite S&M picture? A businessman, who **DOTH** the bidding of his _taskmistress_ , is _climaxing_ and yelling out " お願い致します " while she whips and says " どう致しまして ". (This kanji also means "to bring about" and "do humbly", which is perfect for this image).;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 23-4-2007(208): To reach _climax_ I **doth** the bidding of my dominatrix _taskmaster_.

眠;sleep;Eyes . . . people.;1) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 26-9-2006(225): In an Orwellian sense, the _eye_ watching the _people_ never **sleep** s.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-7-2007(63): People need to close their eyes and **sleep**.
刀;sword;Although this character no longer looks very much like a **sword** , it does have some resemblance to the handle of the **sword**.

個;individual;Person . . . harden.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-8-2006(120): This keyword gave me trouble, I could write the kanji from memory but could not remember the keyword the other way around. In such case the dictionary definition can be helpful : "Middle English, single, indivisible". Here we have _Mr. T._ who is so _hardened_ (all the body workout he's had) that he became **in-dividual** , that is, in-divisible. "I pity da foo who can be divided into smaller units.".;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 5-9-2007(86): _Mr. T_ insists that people be **individual**.

But a **BOUGH** is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large **bough** s, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.
罪;guilt;Eye . . . jail cell.;1) [[Thora](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora)] 21-2-2008(208): **Guilt** y under the _eye_ s of the law, therefore sentenced to _jail_.

夏;summer;In the **summer** , fatigued by the heat, your _head_ hangs down nearly as far as your _walking legs_ , or rather, your "dragging legs." Note how the _walking legs_ (instead of  "animal legs") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for _page_ (Frame 64).;1) [[Birdsong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong)] 8-5-2007(172): In **SUMMER** you are hot from the top of your _head_ down to your _walking legs_.;2) [[rachels](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rachels)] 28-7-2008(114): _One_ _drop_ of sweat runs into my _eye_ , when I go _walking_ on a hot **summer** day.

奇;strange;The elements we are given to work with here are _St. Bernard dog_ and _can_. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word _can_. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along)  to stick closely to the elements, in this case, _mouth_  and _nails_. Now all we need do is create a fictitious  " **Strange** But True " column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a _St. Bernard_ whose _mouth_ has been _nailed_ shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard.;1) [[Beeber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beeber)] 12-6-2007(238): I find it **strange** that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train.

A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the _altar_ a "visual once over" as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?).;2) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 2-9-2006(105): [inspection, regard as, see, look at] **Inspection** : you 示 [show](../v4/1086.html) (#1086 示) and someone else 見 [see](../v4/57.html) (#57 見).

予;beforehand;Think of this character as identical to the _halberd_ (Frame 1311) except that the final stroke has been omitted. Return to that character and devise some image to take this difference into account.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 28-9-2006(302): **Beforehand** , this was a _halberd_ but I cut it short so it could **be for hand** to hand combat.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 12-9-2006(126): Your _halberd_ doesn't have a handguard? You should have thought of that **beforehand** (i.e., before you were missing your hand).
富;wealth;Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for **wealth** is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the **wealth** is kept under the roof of the same _house_.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(102): Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the **wealth**!

骨;skeleton;This kanji and primitive refers to the _part of the body_ composed of the bones and their joints.

With all the hair and flesh gone the crown has slipped down to the shoulders like a necklace. 月 represents the rest of the body of the **skeleton**. [Idea for position of crown thanks to n1williams].
善;virtuous;_Sheep_ . . . _horns_ . . . _mouth_. Pay special attention to the writing of this character.;1) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 16-12-2007(297): Imagine a priest's teaching: "To achieve **virtue** one must first submit himself as a _sheep_ to God's flock, rejecting the _horns_ of Satan and resisting the _mouth_ of Hell.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 9-1-2007(95): To be **virtuous** , a good rule to follow is to put your _sheepishness_ (discretion) over your _horns_ (anger) before using your _mouth_.

Do not confuse with _complete_ (Frame 101), _end_ (Frame 1452), or _perfect_ (Frame 199).;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 12-7-2007(136): When the _goalkeeper_ **finish** es the game, he drinks a lot of _water_ and adjusts himself.;2) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 6-6-2007(98): **Finish** him!

" Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible.;1) [[Brad_Thomas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Brad_Thomas)] 22-6-2006(135): 'Sun' 'Mend' - It **just so** happens that _sun_ shine can _mend_ your gloomy spirits.;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 24-1-2008(72): My image here is of Fabrice (the guy who runs this website) spending all _day_ obsessively _mending_ the code so this page looks **just so…**.

I'll not endure any vegetarian children in my house!
約;promise;Consider for a moment the etymology of the word " **promise** " in order to notice its roots in the activity of putting one thing (e.g., one's word of honor) in place of another (e.g., the fulfillment of a task). For as it turns out, this character also means "to abridge, economize, and abbreviate" \- all activities that involve putting one thing in place of another.

(Slight tweak of chamcham's story, using fuaburisa's idea for remembering where to put the mountain primitive.).
矢;dart;When shot high into the _heavens_ , the **dart** gets so small it looks like a mere _drop_. Although this character could as well mean  "arrow," it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word.;1) [[libsrone](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone)] 18-6-2008(180): Zeus ran out of lightning bolts and has to drop **dart** s from the heavens.;2) [[usis35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35)] 16-6-2008(80): Do not mistake with LOSE 失 .

(The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle, see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean _sun_ also. The elements are: _pinnacle_ . . . _piggy bank_.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 21-1-2006(191): A kid is perched on a _pinnacle_ with his _piggy bank_.

警;admonish;Here you have a perfect example of how an apparently impossible snarl of strokes becomes a snap to learn once you know its elements.

犬;dog;We know that the character for _large_ takes on the meaning of the _St. Bernard_ **dog** when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The _drop_ added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized **dog** , which compared to the _St. Bernard_ is no more than a _drop_ in the kennel.;1) [[LucidFaia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia)] 9-4-2008(76): A large **dog** , dripping drool.;2) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 24-3-2008(17): If we remember [large](../v4/107.html) (#107 大) as a man with his arms outstretched, the **drop** represents man's best friend - a **dog**.

Western mythical imagination has old  "Father Time" leaning on his sickle with a **newborn babe** crawling around his _legs_ , the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on.

照;illuminate;Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for **illuminate** can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something _shine_. If you glaze a pot and put it into the _oven_ to _fire_ it, you in fact _illuminate_ it. Hence the kanji for **illuminate** compares the kanji for _shining_ with the primitive element for the _oven's fire_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(276): SHINING FLAMES **illuminate**!;2) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 16-9-2007(91): The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we **illuminate** the night.

But unlike war , putting **Ketchup** on it will usually solve the problem. **Wall** (dingomick), Did anyone else used to put ketchup packets on the _ground_ and jump on them so they spattered on the **wall**?
婚;marriage;Woman . . . family name . . . day.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 4-12-2005(270): **Marriage** is the _day_ in this _woman_ 's life where she gets a new _family name_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 20-2-2008(90): Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji 昏 [dusk](../v4/2451.html) (#2451 昏).

周;circumference;Look more closely at your _lidded crock_ and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the **circumference** of your _motorcycle helmet_ : just begin at a fixed point and turn the _lidded crock_ around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the _helmet_ , until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your _lidded crock_ made, you now know the **circumference**.;1) [[hanako1975](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanako1975)] 8-1-2008(188): If my LIDDED CROCK has the same **CIRCUMFERENCE** as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET.;2) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 3-4-2009(47): When the _ground_ has an _opening_ (a hole), you need to cover the entire **circumference** or you will fall in.

鉄;iron;Metal . . . to drop.;1) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 17-6-2006(282): **Iron** is a _metal_ that gradually becomes _lost_ due to oxidation and rust.;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 20-10-2008(105): Compare with [pig-iron](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/270) (#270 銑). In moving from **pig-iron** to **iron** , some of the _metal's_ maleability is _LOST_. (The only difference between the two kanji is that **IRON** has knee- less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.).
易;easy;Sun . . . knot.;1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 21-11-2007(210): The _sun_ is _not_ an **easy** place to get to.;2) [[saranich](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich)] 31-3-2006(128): Under the sun, it is **easy** to untie a knot.

狂;lunatic;A **lunatic** is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the  " **looneys** " are the legendary lycanthropes or "wolfmen." Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going **looney** and setting himself up as _king_ of a _pack of wild dogs_ that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(201): Oh no ! A _pack of dogs_ has bitten the _king_. He has turned into a rabid **lunatic** !;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 19-11-2006(32): Think of _King_ Nebuchadnezzar, who for 7 years **lost his sanity** and had to live like a _wild animal_.

英;England;_Flowers_ . . . _center_.

帯;sash;The part of the _apron_ where one finds the _buckle_ (represented pictorially by the first 5 strokes) is on the **sash**.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 10-6-2006(166): First, note that the top half of the kanji consists of _one_ and _mountain_. Of course, the " _number 1_ " _mountain_ in Japan is _Mt._ Fuji. The bottom half, under _Mt._ Fuji, consists of _crown_ and _towel_. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under _Mt._ Fuji (Japan's _#1_ _mountain_ ) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it's royal because of the _crown_ ) discover what looks like a _towel_ , but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal _sash_ for the king's kimono.;2) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 28-3-2009(160): WARNING: Try to avoid thinking of the upper element as a combination of _one_ and _mountain_ , because in this case you will get used to the incorrect stroke order.

Oh, the **cause** is that you kept the _dog_ _pent in_ the house all day. Next time remember to walk him.
踏;step;The meaning of this character is virtually identical with that of the last frame. Be sure to come up with distinct connotations suggested by phrases in which each is commonly used. _Wooden leg_ . . . _water_ . . . _sun_.;1) [[trikatu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trikatu)] 28-2-2007(219): You have to watch your **step** when moving your _leg_ on a _watery day_.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 16-5-2007(80): So, we've walked on the moon, but it's going to take a pirate with a _wooden leg_ , with a huge supply of cooling _water_ to land on the _sun_ and take that "one small **step** for a man".

Make sure to use a potholder!;2) [[Clint](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint)] 13-7-2008(33): **Hot water** is a phrase that can mean "getting into trouble." This kanji pictures just one of the many meanings of that phrase: it's _water_ that you get into (with creditors and the like) when your _piggy bank_ is empty!
移;shift;Wheat . . . many.;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 28-8-2007(229): Picture the WHEAT field, filled with MANY, MANY stalks of WHEAT. Notice how they **SHIFT** like waves in the slightest breeze.

倉;godown;The single _gate_ is used here not in order to represent one _gate_ , but many of them, indeed a _meeting of gates_. Add _mouth_ (as an entrance here) and you end up with **godown**. That should help keep this character distinct from _warehouse_ (Frame 633).;1) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 5-10-2007(256): (Warning-this one is crude) Imagine a **godown** (dockside warehouse) where you can _meet_ girls who will _godown_ on you with their _mouth_. To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one _gate_.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 26-10-2005(56): Hint : the "godown" is like a warehouse, it's on the docks and mostly in Asia. To make an image distinct from that of "warehouse" or "storehouse", etc, I picture the goods stored there, piled up on pallets really high, and thus they have to "godown" before they can be taken outside. The front of this **godown** is a " _meeting of small gates_ ", i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The _mouth_ can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods.
甲;armor;This kanji reverses the element for _sprout_ , giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the _rice field_. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, **armor**.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 20-1-2006(200): Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai's **armor**. Then I looked up images of the samurai **armor** and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai **armor** because of the "turtle samurai" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.;2) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 21-11-2007(156): It looks like a bird's eye view of a tank (modern **armor** ).

(Easy to remember, Underlined Family Name = Business Card).
積;volume;_Wheat_ . . . _blame_. This key word has to do with measurement, and should be kept distinct from the kanji for _quantity_ (Frame 189) - even though the meanings are similar.;1) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 12-9-2006(207): On many _wheat cereal_ boxes, there is a disclaimer stating that "This package is sold by weight, not by **volume**. Some settling of contents may have occurred." well they only say that because they don't want to be _blame_ d by people getting really disappointed after they see what a small **volume** of _cereal_ the box really contains.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 4-3-2007(138): The **volume** of the _wheat_ crop is way down this year! _Blame_ the weather!
婆;old woman;Waves . . . woman.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(325): An **old woman** is seen here as a woman with waves (i.e. wrinkles, creases).;2) [[walexander5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5)] 20-7-2008(58): Picture an **old woman** on her balcony, watching the _waves_ , wondering if her husband will ever return from the sea.

And so it is that we have **havens**.;1) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 13-10-2007(215): A brush laying in dirty water is a **haven** for bacteria.;2) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 4-7-2008(78): The **haven** for a BRUSH is in WATER.. Otherwise they get dry and withered and cant be used?!
訪;call on;When making a courtesy **call on** a dignitary, one has to gauge one's _words_ with great care. Hence the need for a _compass_.;1) [[GenPDP7](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GenPDP7)] 20-12-2007(234): When you **call on** someone, you point your words in their direction.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 22-3-2007(71): Japanese streets usually don't have names, so finding places can be difficult. So if you plan to **call on** someone you need two things, 1) _words_ (for asking the way) and 2) a _compass_ (in case you get really lost).
魔;witch;_Hemp_ . . . _ghost_. Take care not to confuse with the primitive of the same name we learned earlier (Frame 458).;1) [[taijuando](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando)] 10-12-2006(230): The **witch** sold me some _hemp_ that made me see _ghosts_ don't do drugs.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 7-7-2006(62): This modern version of the **witch** lives in some hippie community.

But he sang only RIGHTEOUS songs, no cursing or anything like that. (all true: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_rBidCkJxo> ).
魚;fish;The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: _bound up_ . . . _rice field_ . . . _cooking fire_. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a **fish** is caught and _bound up_ on a line with its unfortunate school-mates, when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the _rice fields_ for fertilizer, and the rest he sets in a skillet over a _cooking fire_ for his supper.;1) [[silkcherryblossoms](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/silkcherryblossoms)] 10-6-2007(106): The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind **fish**.;2) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 12-2-2008(56): _Bind_ that **FISH** and _cook_ his _brains_!

I prefer to decompose the kanji in three elements here because it is easier to read like a mnemonic.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 15-8-2007(84): WOMEN get very **ANGRY** over the thought that GUYS are more interested in her CROTCH than her HEART.

午;noon;With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of **noon**.

束;bundle;In the same way that we were able to see the _sun_ in the _tree_ within the kanji for _east_ , here we see a square container in the shape of a _mouth_.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 7-10-2006(184): Mnemonic: **Bundle** of joy.

晴;clear up;Take the key word in its associations with the weather (unless that tempts you to include the primitive for _weather_ , which doesn't belong here). Its elements: _sun_ . . . _blue_.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 22-2-2006(378): Sun and blue sky! Yep, the weather's cleared up!;2) [[dilandau23](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23)] 1-4-2007(25): When we speak of **clearing up** we easily think of both the _sun_ and _blue_ skies. But in another since to **clear up** is the absence of weather. And therefor the reason weather has no place in its writing.

They have glued themselves to the **timber-trees** and are beating their drums.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 17-1-2008(49): To the cutting down of **timber-trees** and the destruction of the forest, the hippies have staged a protest demonstration using a _drum_ in the _middle of the town_ (see [town](../v4/208.html) (#208 村)).

Too bad I had to have my anus _glued_ shut from the damage it did to my digestive system…;2) [[Hinode](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode)] 13-2-2009(83): _Red Bull_ , the [chieftain](../v4/2906.html) (#2906 酋) is so **revered** in his clan that everyone sticks to him like _glue_.

The weird thing is that it burns from the bottom upwards, hanging in the air as if my magic. Try it and see!;2) [[Alucard](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alucard)] 8-12-2006(112): When the _sun_ burns the _wheat_ a smell of **incense** remains in the air.
統;overall;Thread . . . allot.;1) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 2-8-2007(182): _Spidey_ is _alloted_ the biggest crime fighter jurisdiction in NYC because his **OVERALL** arrest record is the best.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 22-5-2007(142): According to Greek mythology, there's a _thread_ _alloted_ to everyone, and its length is the **overall** determinant of your fate.

述;mention;Resin . . . road.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 16-5-2007(172): Why are the roads leading through the woods so sticky and dirty? Hmm… I think the forest ranger **mention** ed something about excess _resin on the roads_ …;2) [[tristanthorn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn)] 18-3-2009(112): No-body **mention** ed that there was _resin_ on the _road_. Now I'm stuck!
沈;sink;The technique for **sinking** used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a _crown_ tied about one _leg_ before the unfortunate party is tossed into the _water_.;1) [[jreaves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves)] 20-7-2007(178): (thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she **sink** s.

One of the most ridiculous of these involved a man _rowing_ himself in a boat around the _sun_.
払;pay;Finger . . . elbow.;1) [[misha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha)] 3-8-2007(326): You're at a restaurant and raise your _finger_ to indicate to the waiter that you want to **pay**.

欲;longing;_Valley_ . . . _yawn_. Be sure to keep the key word distinct from _pining_ (Frame 683).;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 22-6-2008(283): Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲 , lust. As for a story: the _lack_ of contact with a woman's _valley_ will leave a man **LONGING** for love.;2) [[mattoc_g](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g)] 20-7-2006(139): The valley has something my life is lacking…. something I've been **longing** for.. peace and quiet.
旦;nightbreak;While we normally refer to the start of the day as "daybreak," Japanese commonly refers to it as the "opening up of night" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, **nightbreak**. The single stroke at the bottom represents the _floor_ (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the _sun_ is poking its head;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(191): A **nightbreak** happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).;2) [[tomb771](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomb771)] 9-2-2007(65): It may be easier to think of the keyword "DAYBREAK" or "MORNING" for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase "SUN rising over the HORIZON" works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕 （たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦 （がんたん） New Year's Day.
固;harden;_Old_ . . . _pent in_. Leave the people out of your story to avoid complications later when we add the element for person to form a new kanji (Frame 1047).;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 10-5-2007(252): Fossils are _old_ things _pent in_ that have **harden** ed.;2) [[Cheesemaster64](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64)] 15-8-2009(113): Remember Metapod from Pokemon? All it used was **harden** , which kept it _pent in_ until it grew _old_ enough to evolve into Butterfree..
護;safeguard;Words . . . flowers . . . vessels.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 8-3-2006(203): Think of the _flower-vessels_ as a the Greenpeace vessel “Arctic Sunrise”, only instead of a rainbow there is a big _flower_ painted on the hull (this will come back in [seize](../v4/701.html) (#701 獲) and [harvest](../v4/908.html) (#908 穫)). Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. – In this kanji, we see an inauguration _speech_ being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to **safeguard** our planet.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 24-11-2007(128): _Words_ and _Flowers_ are exchanged between sailors and their wives before they board the _vessel_ to **safeguard** the world.
銭;coin;Those special _gold_ -colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds from people on the _floats_ give us the kanji for **coins**.;1) [[Squintox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Squintox)] 3-10-2008(125): Interesting fact: The Japanese one yen **coin** is the only **coin** in the world that can float on water. <http://www.hanamiweb.com/floatingyen.jpg>.;2) [[PParisi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PParisi)] 12-10-2007(118): Political hopefuls in Rome threw gold **COIN** S from floats when they were campaigning for office.
皇;emperor;An **emperor** , as we all know, is a ruler - something like a _king_ but higher in status. The _white bird_ perched above the _king_ , elevating him to **imperial** heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that _white birds_ have long done in folklore throughout the world.;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 4-10-2007(151): Ancient Rome had **Emperor** s instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an **emperor** is a _king_ in _white_. (make sure you picture a roman **emperor** not a japanese one and you'll be ok).;2) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 13-10-2008(63): I don't think the Japanese would be happy if their **emperor** was a _white king_ …
皮;pelt;The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for _branch_. The first stroke can then stand for something  "hanging" down from the _branch_ , namely its bark or **pelt**. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(150): A **pelt** is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a **pelt** and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging **pelt** ) and the hook at the end of the second stroke. This is chinese radical #107 meaning “skin”.;2) [[myglagata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata)] 14-5-2008(54): To be honest, this is one of those cases where I have found it easier to "just remember it" as a radical, as it occurs so frequently: 彼 （かれ him） 波 （なみ wave）and so on.
牛;cow;Can you the "doodle" of a **cow** that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs.;1) [[Georgi87](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87)] 1-4-2008(210): A **cow** tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off.;2) [[dannyfartmaxwell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dannyfartmaxwell)] 6-5-2009(44): Mooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
呉;give;The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The _mouth_ and _tool_ are already familiar.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 14-3-2007(262): As a present, I **gave** my dentist a _hand-crank tool_ for spreading _mouths_. He was so happy since it makes his job easier.;2) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 27-10-2006(66): I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a _tool_ with a _crank_ which plays music out of the bell _mouth_. Imaginge **giving** one of these old and beautiful phonographs to a classical or jazz music buff!
秘;secret;Cereal . . . invariably.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 29-5-2007(158): The prize at the bottom of a _cereal_ box is _invariably_ a **secret** decoder ring.;2) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 25-2-2008(120): A young couple meets in **secret** in the _wheat_ field because their families are enemies. They _cross their hearts_ and swear eternal - even if **secret** \- love. Do not confuse with [secrecy](../v4/775.html) (#775 密).
酔;drunk;Whiskey bottle . . . baseball . . . needle.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(267): God you're **drunk**! How many _whiskeys_ did you have? _9_? _10_?;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 7-2-2008(91): Whiskey with 90 percent alcohol will get you **drunk**. I don't care who you are.
捨;discard;Fingers . . . cottage.;1) [[stauff](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stauff)] 11-12-2005(258): Someone stuck their _fingers_ in my _cottage_ cheese! I'm going to have to _discard_ the lot!;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 30-10-2007(145): The wicked witch from Hansel and Gretel only likes the meaty parts of kids. Outside her candy _cottage_ , you can see a pile of **discard** ed _fingers_.
割;proportion;Harm . . . saber.;1) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 10-4-2007(181): [proportion, comparatively, divide, cut, separate, split] Hey, don't take this out of **proportion**! I did you just a little _harm_ , no need to come over here with a _saber_ …;2) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 15-10-2007(136): As shown on this pie-chart, the **proportion** of people _harmed_ by _sabres_ is relatively a small slice compared to those _harmed_ by guns.
柄;design;Tree . . . third class.;1) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 27-4-2008(497): Half Way!!!!;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 19-6-2006(223): This is a " _design_ " as in a "pattern", not a verb as in "to _design_ ". The **tree** grain _design_ was too expensive for the **third class** airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it.
危;dangerous;Bound up . . . unlucky.;1) [[nyquil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil)] 11-2-2007(281): You're _bound up_ by ropes to an _unlucky_ person. It's **dangerous** , because whatever happens to him will happen to you too.;2) [[greenapple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple)] 24-5-2006(37): While rock climbing you are bound to the cliff by just your fingerprints, which is why it's so **dangerous**.
甚;tremendously;_Bushel basket_ . . . _equal_. Note how the first stroke of _equal_ doubles up with the sixth stroke of the _bushel basket_ , and how the _animal legs_ of the _bushel basket_ are dropped to make room for the _human legs_ of _equal_.;1) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 3-4-2007(203): It's a tremendous match between the two chess-players. They are clearly eachother's equal.;2) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 4-8-2007(49): These two _bushel baskets_ are **tremendously** huge. But not only they are huge, they are also perfectly _equal_ in size.
便;convenience;_Person_ . . . _grow late_. Hint: this kanji also means that unmentionable material that one disposes of when one goes to the  " **conveniences**. ";1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-12-2007(164): _Mr. T_ loves the **convenience** of the new konbini. Not only does it stay open even if it _grows late_ , they have brand new _toilets_ , and a _Post Office_!;2) [[cbogart](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart)] 26-2-2007(79): Mr. T takes a dump on the floor of a **convenience** store. Well, it was growing late and he couldn't wait. He pities the fool who will have to clean it up!

The kanji also means to roar, make up noise, to kick up a fuss and to make merry. Perhaps it is exactly the etymology behind this kanji.
聴;listen;_Ear_ . . . _needle_ . . . _eye_ . . . _heart_. Compare frame 427 for this and the following kanji, and then once again when you get to frame 950.;1) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 26-2-2008(250): I promise to use my _ear_ to do nothing but **listen** … stick a _needle_ in my _eye_ , cross my _heart_ and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).;2) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 14-8-2006(115): **Listen** ing to others is different from hearing [1626] with the _ear_. One must allow the words to pierce through the _eyes_ (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the _heart_ …a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, "You're not **listen** ing to me, are you?" He replies, "I heard every word you said. You said…" “Yes, but you're not **listen** ing.".

The serve is rarely returned, so the games tend to be **short**.———— This character apparently refers to duration, not just to height.
席;seat;Caverns . . . towel.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 18-4-2007(192): Remember those poor commoners huddled in groups of 20 in a cave? The only thing they had for a **seat** was some old toweling (while their lords could recline on luxurious couches).;2) [[epsilondelta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta)] 14-12-2009(62): PRIMITIVE: _Cave_ \+ _twenty_ = **Finnish sauna** (instead of Heisig's "caverns", which I'd confuse with "cave"). STORY: You don't directly sit on the wooden **seat** in the _sauna_ – rather, you put a _towel_ underneath.
哲;philosophy;Fold . . . mouth.;1) [[ithil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ithil)] 2-11-2006(229): A two-hour lesson of **philosophy** in high school.

依;reliant;Person . . . garment.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(148): Mr T is **reliant** (depends on) on his garment (the gold chains).;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 9-3-2008(49): Mr. T. is so self-reliant he even makes his own garments.
帝;sovereign;An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning **sovereign** has him _standing up_ in his _apron_ , presumably at the behest of HIS **sovereign** (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 6-7-2006(254): The crazy **sovereign** stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That's why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 16-2-2008(51): This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the _standing_ element takes those little crown "winglets" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She's _standing_ on her _crown_ rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her _apron._ I guess the **sovereign** 's servants have the day off.
捕;catch;Fingers . . . dog tag.;1) [[bihzad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad)] 1-5-2008(196): I was retreating from the battlefield. In the chaos, my friend threw his dogtags at me to give to his family. I managed to **catch** them with my fingers as the chopper was lifting off.;2) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 20-8-2007(84): _Dog tag_ : This is a wild animal track device. It has an _arrowhead_ and _screwdriver_ -shaped radio beacon. It's evidently fired in animals to track their movements. When animal has a _dog tag_ , it's easy to **catch** it: just take a _dog tag_ in your _fingers_.
池;pond;_Water_ . . . _scorpion_. It would be easy to slip into a  "lazy image" in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a _scorpion_ near the _water_. But if you picture rather a _scorpion_ letting its venom out _drop by drop_ until it has made a whole **pond** of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed.;1) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 13-7-2008(110): Remember the story of the _scorpion_ that begged the turtle for a ride across the **pond**? Halfway across the _water_ , the _scorpion_ stung the turtle on the neck and they both sank to the bottom.;2) [[yvanc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yvanc)] 14-6-2007(62): Water scorpions loves to live in the **pond**.
級;class;Threads . . . outstretched hands.;1) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 19-5-2008(276): This Kanji is the same ones used in the Japanese Language proficiency tests, i.e. ikkyuu ( 一級 ) The Kanji doesnt describe **class** as in a "class of students" or "classroom," but rather a grade of quality or ability. ———- Spiderman is taking the JLPT Level 1. In desperation he REACHES OUT to grab his friend's answer sheet next to him, who seems to be doing well. The other test takers are obviously a **class** above him. Looks like this test is above his **class** of knowledge.;2) [[jamiemw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw)] 17-9-2007(65): Spiderman with his arm stretched out showing the **class** how he produces webs.
秀;excel;Wheat . . . fist.;1) [[GoodSirJava](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GoodSirJava)] 23-11-2006(370): You spend three hours putting all of your _wheat_ sale transaction records into **Microsoft **Excel**** , when suddenly it crashes, so you put your _fist_ through the monitor.;2) [[jameserb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb)] 12-3-2008(133): A soviet-era poster for the 5-year plan shouts "Excel" and shows a fist clenching a sheaf of wheat. Wheat/Fist.
植;plant;You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to **plant** a young _tree_ and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up _straight_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(273): **Plant** s don't become _tree_ s _straightaway_.;2) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 28-6-2008(109): When you **plant** **plant** s, you use a piece of WOOD to make the **plant** grow STRAIGHT.
陰;shade;Just as the _sunshine_ (Frame 1397) represents the masculine principle in nature (Yang), the **shade** stands for the feminine principle (Yin). Its elements are: _pinnacle_ . . . _clock_ . . . _rising cloud_.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-3-2007(238): The only **shade** at _The Pinnacle_ is in the shadow of the giant _clock_ tower, or from a _rising cloud_.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 26-2-2008(40): Frosty the snowman is running around the pinnacle, staying in the **shade**. As he looks at his clock to see how much longer he can last, small clouds rise (steam) from his body. Nooo, Frosty!
刺;thorn;**Thorns** grow on a bush here that has wrapped itself around a _tree_ like a _belt_ , cutting into the poor _tree_ like little _sabers_.;1) [[wazato](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato)] 30-9-2007(166): A TREE with a BELT wrapped around the middle. If you tighten the BELT, hundreds of tiny SABERS pop out of the tree in all directions, looking like **THORN** S.;2) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 7-9-2006(34): The BELT TREE has **THORN** S like SABERS.
伏;prostrated;Person . . . chihuahua.;1) [[cbogart](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart)] 25-11-2006(224): Don't need a silly story for this one: prostration is when a person puts themselves in a low position like a dog, as an extreme gesture of humility.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 5-9-2007(114): _Mr T_ has beaten up the _chihuahua_ , who lies **prostrated** in front of him. "Now," _Mr T_ says, "I quiero some Taco Bell!".
撃;beat;Car . . . missile . . . hand.;1) [[inuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki)] 16-1-2007(429): Your car has missles?! That **beat** s mine, hands down.;2) [[genbaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku)] 9-1-2008(115): Think 3 methods of attack all combined into 1 kanji: 1. Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to **beat** the enemy.
穴;hole;_House_ . . . _eight_.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 28-8-2007(249): A black **hole** is a "House of Infinity". Infinity is of course represented by a sideways "8", but here we have a Japanese "8" instead.;2) [[zz_alex_zz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz)] 19-2-2008(105): Billiards anyone? _House_ rules here state that the first person to pot the _eight_ ball into the **hole** wins the game.
懸;suspend;Prefecture . . . yarn . . . heart.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(201): The _prefecture_ has **suspend** ed all _DNA_ research for _heart_ disease because of corruption. All involved will be **suspend** ed by their wrists.;2) [[mattimus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus)] 12-1-2010(95): In a very racist _prefecture_ of Japan, they screen everyone's _DNA_. If they find out you are of a different _lineage_ , they rip out your _heart_ and **suspend** it in the Hall of Shame.
完;perfect;In order not to confuse the key word **perfect** with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. _Per- factum_ suggests something so  "thoroughly made or done" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a _house_ that has been made **perfectly** from its _beginnings_ in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for _complete_.;1) [[yukina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukina)] 3-11-2006(172): Make the **perfect** impression in the _beginning_ by removing your shoes upon entering a Japanese _home_.;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 2-12-2007(154): In the beginning, Adam and Eve had a home in Eden. It was **perfect**.
触;contact;Angle . . . insect.;1) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 7-5-2007(254): For _insects_ to get in **contact** with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right _angle_.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 8-12-2007(70): Wow, he threw that BOOMERANG with such skill, it made **CONTACT** with that INSECT in mid flight.
伯;chief;Person . . . white dove.;1) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 30-1-2006(96): If _Mr T_ was _white_ I am sure he would have been commander in **chief** of the USA, he just the sort of clown Americans love to vote for. (NB: I tried with the indian **chief** motif but kept adding feathers by mistake).;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 5-9-2007(63): _Mr T_ was originally supposed to be the **chief** of the A-Team, but then the producers realized that America didn't want to see a Black guy as the **chief** of a prime-time TV show. So here, we see _Mr T_ doing a bunch of _cocaine_ , and then spreading it all over his face to look _white_ , and trying out for the part of Hannibal. The directors were so impressed that they let him stunt double for Hannibal in a few episodes. OR, _Mr T_ **chief** in' on some _crack cocaine_. You make the call.
忍;endure;Blade . . . heart. **Endure** here means long-suffering patience.;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 22-10-2006(280): A ninja must be able to **endure** the pain of clinging to a ceiling, motionless, for hours at a time, waiting for just the right moment to drop down and thrust the _blade_ of his sword into the _hearts_ of his enemies. By the way, this character is used in the compound 忍者 ( _ninja_ ) which is why I choose to use _ninja_ as its primitive meaning.;2) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 17-3-2008(60): 忍び （しのび）Shinobi the 忍者 （にんじゃ）Ninja was able to **endure** the massacre of his family  & horrors of his training by placing the way of the _blade_ above the way of the _heart_.
懐;pocket;State of mind . . . needle . . . eyes . . . garment.;1) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 11-2-2008(260): (re: taijuando) When you are in New York City you have to be alert, i.e. in the "New York _State of Mind_ ": you need _ten_ _eyes_ to make sure no one will go through your _garments_ and pick your **pocket** s.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 26-3-2007(44): She had me in her **pocket**. It was a _state of mind_ that would eventually _demolish_ me… —I use this story with a kind of unrequited love theme not only because it jives with my romantic soul, but also because this kanji also has connotations of attachment and sentiments/feelings.
隅;corner;Pinnacle . . . Talking Cricket.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-4-2007(153): _Jiminy Cricket_ has a favorite **corner** he likes to slip into at _The Pinnacle_ for a long drink.;2) [[Angrybeez](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez)] 20-5-2008(51): Oh how the pious fall from their lofty _pinnacles_! _Jiminy Cricket_ now deals drugs on the street **corner**.
了;complete;Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the "arms" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a _child_ with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully **completed**.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 8-9-2007(252): The experiment was a **complete** failure! The child was made without any arms!;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(73): A child with the arms inside the blanket will be **complete** ly wrapped up.

Then the _sun_ suddenly burst out in an **outburst** over the _Ark_ and there was an **outburst** of cheering.

I suggest " _parasol_ " (because it is the same _shape_ as an _umbrella_ ). REF: _rare_ (FRAME 1723) , [check-up](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724) (#1724 診), [measles](../v4/2574.html) (#2574 疹), [fallible](../v4/2720.html) (#2720 謬).
区;ward;The **ward** referred to here is a subdivision of a large city. Its elements: _box_ . . . _sheaves_. When used as a primitive element, it may be helpful at times to break it up into these same composite elements.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-9-2007(175): That's the homeless **ward** of the city. _Wolverine_ lives in a _cardboard box_ there.;2) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 31-1-2006(33): In the **ward** office the _sheaves_ of paper of the **ward** registration forms are kept in a _box_.
洗;wash;This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: _water_ . . . _before_. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called  "Pigpen," who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him " **Wash** -Out." Everywhere he walks, a spray of _water_ goes _before_ him to sanitize everything he touches.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 10-2-2008(286): In Japan, you always **wash** with _water_ from the shower _before_ you enter the bathtub.;2) [[undershaft](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undershaft)] 27-2-2007(80): You **wash** things with WATER to get them back to the clean state they were in BEFORE.

What, you didn't know that? They do. Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees. **Plum** s are simply mutant fruits that have been installed in the root software of every single tree. I hear that some **plum** -loving scientists are working on a way to hack _every_ _tree's_ genetic code so that _every tree_ will bear nothing _but_ **plum** s.;2) [[Spoonz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz)] 1-3-2009(74): _every_ man's _wood_ has 2 **plum** s.
智;wisdom;Know . . . sun.;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 22-11-2006(236): **Wisdom** is knowing everything OVER the sun (fools assume everything UNDER).;2) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 1-12-2007(200): _Knowing_ more each _day_ , brings **wisdom**.
迫;urge;To **urge** someone to do something, you make the _way_ as appealing as possible, perhaps even _white_ washing it a bit.;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 13-10-2006(179): When you have the **URGE** to go to _White_ Castle, you know it's time to hit the _road_.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(106): When you start down the **road** of **cocaine** , you're sure to feel some pretty bad **URGE** s soon.

惑;beguile;The first three elements, _fiesta_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _floor_ , appeared together once already in frame 380. Beneath them, once again, the _heart_.;1) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 25-9-2007(372): She was **beguiled** / **mislead** by his charm: at the party he kissed her on the _mouth_ , they did it on the _floor_ and thus he stole her _heart_. Poor girl!;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 16-1-2006(92): The same cowboy from frame # 356 (elements mouth, floor and fiesta), kisses the floor with his mouth, once again, before going to the fiesta. There, he uses his good looks to **beguile** women (gets them to buy him drinks or such), by playing with their hearts.
基;fundamentals;Bushel basket . . . soil.;1) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 11-12-2007(218): **Fundamentals** of _chess_ : use the _rooks_ to protect your _ground_.;2) [[bigloui](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui)] 9-4-2006(28): A _Bushel-basket_ full of _earth_ contains the fundementals of farming. i.e. earth.

才;genius;Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special " **genius** " \- one can do very easily, "with one finger" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for _fingers_ backwards.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 31-10-2007(143): Spinal tap: "Every other band's amps go to _ten_. But you see my _extra stroke_ of **genius** \- these go to eleven.".;2) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 29-6-2008(133): A TEN year old had a STROKE of **GENIUS** and wrote this joke: [何歳ですか？](midori://search?text=何歳ですか？) [。。。天才です！](midori://search?text=。。。天才です！) .
称;appellation;Wheat . . . reclining . . . little.;1) [[wrightak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak)] 16-5-2006(224): Taking **appellation** to mean the act of naming, we have the _little_ baby superman _reclining_ in the space craft that landed in a _wheat_ field. Mr. and Mrs. Kent look down and decide to call him Clark. (I also thought of Jesus but he was born in a barn full of hay not wheat).;2) [[the_marshal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal)] 17-1-2007(119): _WHEAT_ that is _RECLINING_ and _LITTLE_ ( _small_ ) can't get the _APPELLATION_ "quality wheat".
膝;knee;Flesh . . . tree . . . umbrella . . . rice grains.;1) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 26-7-2009(80): Before [lacquer](../v4/932.html) (#932 漆) was made with water, it was made by draining this _body part_ of fluid: the **knee**!;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 2-8-2008(44): Back in ancient Japan, people didn't have **knee** pads for things like rollerblading and such (what, come on. Ninjas on rollerblades. Ultimate 90s flashback). Instead, they would simply dip their **knee** s in _laquer_ , and wait until it dried (hence the _flesh_ , and the abscence of any _drops of water_ ). Unfortunately, this meant that you would have to wait about 30 minutes after deciding to go rollerblade until you could actually do it (took some time to dry) - and removing it was a serious pain.
豊;bountiful;Bend . . . table. Think of a **bountiful** harvest, and you will not be far from the meaning of this character.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 17-6-2006(256): The **bountiful** feast was so **bountiful** that it _bent_ the _table_ below it under its weight! いただきま〜す！.;2) [[WithLoveFromExIA](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA)] 26-1-2013(64): Her bust and bum was so **bountiful** I couldn't resist the urge to _bend_ her over a nearby _table_ and…
崎;promontory;_Mountain_ . . . _strange_. Hint: you might save yourself the trouble of a story here simply by recalling the kanji for _cape_ (Frame 164) and toying around with the differing images suggested by the key words **promontory** and _cape_.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 30-1-2008(297): This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with _mountain_ in place of _soil_. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives _stone_ and _strange_. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which **promontory** is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.;2) [[Aerin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin)] 3-9-2007(128): A **promontory** is a small, _strange mountain_ that juts out into the sea.
剣;saber;_Awl_ . . . _saber_. As we promised way back in frame 87, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-9-2007(140): If it helps, make the awl primitive **ice pick** instead. They're basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the **icepick** vs. the _saber_ …;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 2-7-2008(96): Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of "The _Awl and the Sabre_ ". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an _awl_ against a _sabre_! She used to work all day with that _awl_. However, the bandit using the _sabre_ had no skill. And thus the _awl_ beat the _sabre_. And from there the saying goes : "The _sabre_ is powerless against the _awl_ , if one can't use the _sabre_.".
厳;stern;Owl . . . cliff . . . daring.;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 2-11-2005(158): This represents a **stern** looking owl, perched up on a cliff. This cliff is quite famous for daring individuals to cliff dive off of, but is any of them daring enough to threaten the owl?;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 9-3-2008(70): ( 厳しい strict, **stern** ) You remember of course the daring fella who had his ear pierced and went standing in front of the taskmaster. The taskmasters punishment was very **stern** /strict. Fella thrown of the cliff, where the owls are ready to feast. No funny guy doing that anymore.

You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he _watched_ over you carefully as [coach](../v4/719.html) (#719 督) ( 督 ). It was uncomfortable, though, how your [uncle](../v4/718.html) (#718 叔) often touched you just _a little above_ the _crotch_ ( 叔 ) when coaching…

斎;purification;_Plaid_ . . . _fenceposts_ . . . _altar_. This is a  "religious" **purification** , which distinguishes it from the simple kanji for _pure_ (Frame 1659).;1) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 20-9-2006(90): A scottish priest in a _tartan_ kilt has put his altar between a couple of _fence posts_ and is now playing the bagpipes in a very Scottish **purification** rite.;2) [[decals](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals)] 16-2-2009(62): An exorcism, or "purification" of the soul.

Note how the second element is cut short, giving a tent-like effect to the character.;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 8-8-2007(404): A **ritual** such as a circumcision: a small piece of flesh from the crotch is left on the altar.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(41): There are many famous penis **matsuri** s(festivals) in Japan. The **ritual** s of these festivals involve placing the _flesh_ of the _crotch_ on an _altar_.

Yeah, that's the **gist** of it!
脚;shins;_Part of the body_ . . . _instead_. This character has more or less the same meaning as that for _leg_ learned back in frame 1372. It can also indicate the part of the legs from the **shins** down, which explains the choice of the key word.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 5-6-2007(266): **Shins** are the _part of the body_ that Japanese traditionally sit on _instead_ of their asses.;2) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 12-10-2007(204): **Shins** are the _part of the body_ that one uses _instead of_ one's eyes, for finding furniture in the dark.

Mnemonic “infant **allot** ed new pair of human legs”. Note: to **allot** means to apportion by lots, it has the same root as the word “lottery”.
講;lecture;Words . . . funnel.;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 7-6-2007(157): I have a _funnel_ attached to my laptop that takes my prof's **lecture** and puts the _words_ into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 12-3-2007(101): Image: a professor walking around with a _funnel_ and simply pouring his _words_ into each students head instead of a **lecture**. (Primitive: _FUNNEL_ , who got the _celery_ stuck in the funnel _again_?! You know it's not supposed to be used for that!).
握;grip;Fingers . . . roof.;1) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 2-10-2007(246): Fingers **grip** ping the roof as your about to fall to your death. Think of an action scene in some movie.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 23-8-2007(69): (This is the にぎ of sushi). A sushi chef _climaxes_ into a rice ball, wraps it in an _American flag_ , and **grips** is firm with his _fingers_ to form the "Fuck You America Onigiri.".

All you want to do is wrap yourself up in a nice warm pelt and get better.

Here, as elsewhere, any of the alternate meanings of the primitives may be used, provided they do not require a position other than that of the kanji in question.;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 21-8-2008(210): To make this **dye** , I used _water_ and the barks of _nine_ different _tree_ s.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 8-8-2007(108): The _baseball_ team hangs their freshly **dye** d _dripping_ jerseys at the top of a _tree_ to dry.

砂;sand;Good **sand** for beaches has _few_ or no _stones_ in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 31-5-2006(143): Here's how I remember that _stone_ is on the left. This is because **sand** starts as _stones_ , and only later they become _few_.;2) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 26-11-2008(112): In good **SAND** , _stones_ are _few_ , if any.

概;outline;_Roots_ . . . _waitress_. Note that the kanji meaning of the two primitives to the right is not used here because we shall later meet a primitive meaning _beforehand_ and want to preempt any confusion. The same holds true in the following frame.;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 1-9-2007(221): A murder has been commited. A corpse was found under a _tree_. The police chalks the **outline** of the victim, an old _silvered_ -haired _waitress_ working at a restaurant nearby.;2) [[RobMow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow)] 16-9-2009(60): If you attempted to **outline** the biography of most famous actresses, you'd find that they have _roots_ working as _waitresses_ before getting their big break.

Think about this kanji in terms of **ACCOMPLISH** or "realize" rather than a sexual encounter. Or, combine the two: the policemen thought they had **accomplished** the task of _driving out_ (see **pursue** , last frame) all the _sows_ , but they received a phone call reporting two _horny_ pigs **CONSUMMATING** on a _road_. When they got there, they found a male and female police officer, not pigs!
鬼;ghost;Drop of . . . brains . . . human legs . . . elbow.;1) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 6-4-2007(189): A **ghost** , or **oni** , wandering slowly on its _human legs_ , searching for _brains_ to eat. What looks like an _elbow_ here is actually a pictoral representation of the _forked tail_ protruding out of its rear.;2) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 18-11-2006(95): **Ghost** s aren't very intelligent - they have but a _drop_ of _brains_ \- so can't tell the difference between an _elbow_ and a pair of _human legs_.
聖;holy;Ear . . . mouth . . . king.;1) [[tcjeff](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff)] 11-6-2008(182): A **holy** man hears with his _ears_ before he speaks with his _mouth_ , which places him higher than a _king_ in people's esteem.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 3-7-2007(175): The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口 . However, this is easy because a true **holy** man uses his _ear_ to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his _mouth_ to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, _king_ s are often true **holy** men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).
汽;vapor;Think of this character as a sibling of that for _spirit_. Simply replace _sheaves_ with drops of _water_ on the left in order to get _vapor_.;1) [[inuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki)] 1-12-2006(197): Water **vapor** almost looks like a spirit but has no soul.;2) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 25-2-2007(44): Wolverine disappears into _water_ **vapor** , seemingly his _spirit_ dissipating into nothingness.
舟;boat;After the _drop_ and the _glass canopy_ , we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for _mama_ (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.;1) [[Copycatken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken)] 29-6-2006(188): I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story **boat** seen from the front. The _glass canopy_ is the body of the **boat**. The _drop_ on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the _ceiling/floor_ between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the _two drops_ in the middle are the lights on the decks.;2) [[jajaaan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan)] 1-1-2010(54): Pictograph of a **boat** seen from above. The middle line is the oars. The drop on top is the rudder (at the back of the **boat** ). The two drops inside represent the passengers: one is bent over with the effort of rowing and the other is sitting up straight, in the front of the **boat** , looking at the horizon for any signs of land.
順;obey;In primitive language, this character would read _stream_ . . . _head_. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of **obey**. Either one **obeys** the person who is _head_ of an organization or else **obeys** by following the _stream_ of opinion ( "current" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji.;1) [[steves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steves)] 10-10-2007(185): "Obey, **Obey**!" says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a _stream_ of orders to fill your _head_.;2) [[jonny49cc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny49cc)] 4-7-2008(92): **Obey** the orders streaming down from head office.
憎;hate;State of mind . . . increase.;1) [[eriklc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eriklc)] 20-11-2005(209): Like the saying goes, **Hate** just begets **Hate**. A state of mind that just increases and increases until it explodes.;2) [[Rivvie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie)] 17-2-2008(85): Your _state of mind_ would turn to **hate** when someone would take away a loved one that was _formerly_ yours.
益;benefit;Poised over the _dish_ here is a pair of _animal horns_ that are attached to a pair of _animal legs_ by a single horizontal stroke.;1) [[shaydwyrm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm)] 19-7-2007(279): The **benefit** of having sharp _horns_ and fast _legs_ is that an animal can get to the food _dish_ first.;2) [[QuackingShoe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuackingShoe)] 23-7-2008(110): The **benefit** of being an animal with _horns_ and fast _legs_ is in keeping it from becoming a _dish_ for the other animals! (shaydwyrm).
泊;overnight;When you stop at an inn for an **overnight** rest, all you expect is a bit of _water_ for a wash and a set of clean _white_ sheets to wrap your weary bones in.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(171): Please supply a guest who stays **overnight** with WATER and WHITE sheets.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-8-2007(99): When I go to an **OVERNIGHT** party, all I need is a bit of **water** and some of that hard **white**. (crack). (not really, but come on. much easier to recall than white sheets).

Story: Here we see an en **camp** ment of military _vehicles_ laying siege to _The Pinnacle_. With other countries being envious of the perfect life they lead there that makes sense.

Have you heard of the _Finger-Turkey_ **conjecture** ? It states that if _turkeys_ had _fingers_ , they would be able to count. Be sure to imagine a turkey with fingers at the tip of its wings, counting from one to ten.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 19-7-2007(87): In the midst of **conjecture** on whether it was done or not, mom stuck her _fingers_ in the _turkey_ to check.
卓;eminent;The word **eminent** suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a _magic wand_ and a _sunflower_  \- is to think of the world's most **eminent** magician as one who uses a _sunflower_ for a _magic wand_ (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).;1) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(338): The most **eminent** magician is he who learned to use his _magic wand early_ in life.;2) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 26-7-2008(38): The world's most **eminent** sourcerer, Harry Potter, used his _magic wand early_ in life.

欠;lack;The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back, the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth, and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a **lack** of something (psychologically, interest, physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.;1) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 13-8-2007(138): To me, this kanji looks like a person with two arms and two legs, but who **lack** s a head.;2) [[bendyarm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bendyarm)] 5-10-2007(56): When your body **lack** s oxygen you _yawn_.
陸;land;The sense of **land** carried by this kanji is distinct from _soil_ (Frame 161) and _ground_ (Frame 554) in that it is meant to represent **land** seen from a distance, that is, _land_ as opposed to  "water." Its elements: _pinnacle_ . . . _rice seedlings_ . . . _ground_.;1) [[fiminor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor)] 11-4-2006(162): My rice-seedlings have become sentient and will go on a mission.

Could it be the Promised **Land**?;2) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 23-7-2006(90): When sailors see **land** in the distance, they first see the _pinnacles_ of the new **land** , but when they come close enough they'll be able to make out the _rice seedlings_ , and finally the _ground_!

糸;thread;Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the _elbows_ and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here **thread** ) while she rolled it up into a _little_ ball? Now can you see the two _elbows_ (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for _little_ below?;1) [[lerris](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris)] 3-7-2007(195): I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I've opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as [dainty](../v4/1363.html) (#1363 細) and [accumulate](../v4/1364.html) (#1364 累).;2) [[Piitaa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa)] 17-7-2006(81): You'll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.
旧;olden times;A _walking stick_ is needed for _days_ of **olden times** , since _days_ , too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the "good old days." The main thing here is to think of "good old days" when you hear the key word **olden times**. The rest will take care of itself.;1) [[gangsterdesunee](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gangsterdesunee)] 17-8-2007(225): Age 18 = **olden times**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(86): The old man with a walking stick kept talking of **olden times** all day long.
省;focus;When we think of **focusing** on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our _eye_ on a _few_ important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a _few_ things and holding them before one's _eye_ in order to **focus** on them better.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(251): You **focus** by concentrating your _eye_ on _few_ er objects.;2) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 26-8-2008(48): To remember the order: When **focusing** , keep a _few_ things your TOP priority, so only they come UNDER your _sight_.

They made the Jews wear a _badge_ on their clothes to identify them. They **hindered** their every movement. Moreover the peace-loving Dutch all wore the _badges_ so that the Jews would be unidentifiable. Effectively **hindering** the Nazi plot.

So picture a SHAKU-HACHI flute being played in ICE cold temperatures. You'll see the **EXHAUST** from your breath as it leaves the SHAKU-HACHI flute.
併;join;The sense of the key word is one of **joining** things together that were previously separate. Its elements: _person_ . . . _puzzle_.;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 16-4-2007(158): _Mr. T_ furiously works a _puzzle_ in an attempt to **join** Mensa, the high-IQ society.;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 30-11-2006(75): "Why do I gotta **join** these two _puzzle_ pieces? I ain't got time for **joining** no jigsaw-jabba!" _Mr. T_ apparently gets a severe case of crankypants when doing puzzles.
惜;pity;_State of mind_ . . . _once upon a time_. The sense of the key word is that of a lost opportunity or bad turn of affairs, as in the phrase  "What a **pity**! ";1) [[jmadsen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen)] 13-2-2006(189): What a **pity**! My _state of mind_ when i think of the opportunities I missed from _once upon a time_.;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 10-11-2008(85): "I **pity** da foo who **borrowed** my place in this kanji!

You can see his crown poking out and the brains splatter out the top of his head from all the pressure.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 20-6-2007(74): Making **tatami mats** from _rice field_ waste was Japan's _crowning_ achievement, but for some reason other countries just _shelved_ the idea.

Think of **examination** as a doctor's **examination**. You're having problems getting _wood_ in bed. You go in for a doctor's **examination**. The doctor shoves an _icepick_ into your manhood as part of the **examination**.
党;party;Think of this key word as referring to a political **party** , not a gala affair. Its elements: _human legs_ . . . sticking out of an _outhouse_ window.;1) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 2-10-2007(424): Every major political **party** , if personified, would look like a giant _outhouse_ walking around with _human legs_ spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 4-9-2007(50): Every political **party** is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here's your answer - a political **party** memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He's grown so accustomed to the taste that he's in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He'll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.
製;made in...;A label indicating that a _garment_ was **made in** U.S.A. or Taiwan or Japan is itself a symbol for the _systematization_ of the _garment_ industry.;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 24-10-2006(155): **Made in** china - a system of exploitation . making garments for nothing.;2) [[gwadonna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gwadonna)] 12-8-2008(89): **Made in…** is a _system_ of labels you can find on every _garment_ s.

呂;spine;This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the **spine** linked by a single stroke.;1) [[Thaliel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thaliel)] 8-7-2006(145): **Spine** connects head and body.;2) [[Senshi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Senshi)] 20-7-2007(54): The **spine** goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.

The kanji is close to frame 1547 "bag", and although the later really refers to a "straw **sack** ", I use the image of a **sack** of potatoes here, and that of a "plastic bag" for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book).

墓;grave;The mounds of _soil_ with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill **graves** we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the _soil_ comes UNDER the _graveyard_ , rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as "lying under boot-hill" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji.;1) [[simple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/simple)] 14-9-2007(212): The _soil_ under a _graveyard_ is full of **graves**.;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 14-10-2007(64): A **grave** is a patch of _soil_ in a _graveyard_.

模;imitation;Ah, but haven't modern _graveyards_ become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing **imitation** _trees_ in the _graveyard_. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.;1) [[Elphalpo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo)] 21-1-2008(149): If I find out this furniture you're selling me is made of **imitation** _wood_ , I'll put you in the _graveyard_.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 15-1-2008(67): The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put **IMITATION** plastic _trees_ in their _graveyards_! (No, not really, but I wouldn't be surprised).
燃;burn;_Hearth_ . . . _sort of thing_. Beware of letting the simple reading off of the primitive elements do your work for you. Unless you make a vivid image of something **burning** and relate it just as vividly to those primitive meanings, you can count on forgetting this character very quickly.;1) [[saruwatari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saruwatari)] 5-1-2008(202): Any sort of thing can **burn** in the fire.;2) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 5-2-2009(59): The Japanese are very particular about what SORT OF THINGs are considered **BURN** able trash and what's not.
型;mould;_Punish_ . . . _soil_. In cases like this, you might find it easier to break the character up into its more basic elements, like this: _two hands_ . . . _saber_ . . . _soil_.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 13-10-2005(231): A famous ninja once pressed his _two hands_ and _saber_ into the _soil_ of his temple, before going onto a mission from which he never came back. Think of some sort of signature that he left behind him. The **mould** of his two hands and saber has since become a popular attraction in the area.;2) [[Ceryn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn)] 5-6-2008(103): As a PUNISHMENT they made me lay face down in the DIRT leaving a nice imprinted **MOULD** of my whole BODY.

(Playing it safe and avoiding the image of a flower completely).;2) [[spoonsman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman)] 9-4-2009(29): It's the circle of life. The _woolly mammoth_ died, but the mammoth's body was able to provide nutrition to the new plants, **blossoming** out of the _mouth_ of the dead _mammoth_.

I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it's the "man" in mandara/mandala ( 曼荼羅 ).

尺;shaku;The key word **shaku** has actually come into English in the word _**shaku** hachi_, the ancient Japanese flute that measured "one **shaku** and eight _sun_ " (the "sun" being about an inch in length). Since the **shaku** is about one foot in length, this makes about 20 inches.

While these differ a bit from the _five holes_ that we used to represent the  " _I_ " (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special _state of mind_ by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji.

兼;concurrently;At the top we have _the animal horns_ and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one _rake_ with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs **concurrently** , using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances.;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 29-1-2008(254): Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a _rake_ , is suddenly attacked from both left and right **concurrently** by bulls with _animal horns_. Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs ( _split rake handle_ ) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again ( _split bottom of each rake handle_ ).;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 12-1-2008(68): You decide to take the bull by the _horns_ and do both chores **concurrently** , grabbing your _double-handled rake_ before attempting to clean up both your's and your neighbours' garden. But unfortunately, it's not long until your _rake_ _splits in two_.
乳;milk;Fledglings . . . hook.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 28-10-2005(315): A _fledgling_ is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed **milk** through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a _hook_ (so that it fits inside its beak). The _fledgling_ soon becomes addicted to **milk** , giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “ _fledgling hooked_ on **milk** ”.;2) [[stehr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr)] 1-10-2007(67): Drinking **milk** not only reduces [cavity](../v4/96.html) (#96 孔)'s but also strengthens _nails_ (claws) thanks astgtciv.
柱;pillar;The **pillar** referred to here is the _wooden_ beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic _candlestick_ and your work is done.;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 9-10-2007(216): The main **pillar** in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the _lord_ of the _trees_.;2) [[potempkin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin)] 30-9-2008(79): "Why has this **pillar** been carved in the shape of a giant penis?!"

摩;chafe;Hemp . . . hand.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(231): If you grind the _hemp_ without a stone but use your _hand_ instead it will **chafe**. (Image: "Robin, why are your hands all **chafe** d?" 'Uh… (I've been grinding hemp all day)').;2) [[Amadan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Amadan)] 9-7-2008(105): Imagine sliding down a _hemp_ rope, without gloves, just bare _hands_. **Chafe** s, doesn't it?
釣;angling;The character we learned for _fishing_ (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the **angling** of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your **angling** rod is a _golden_ _ladle_ which you are using to scoop _gold_ fish out of a river.;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(152): All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers.

舌;tongue;The primitive for _mouth_ and the character for _thousand_ naturally form the idea of **tongue** if one thinks of a _thousand mouths_ able to speak the same language, or as we say,  "sharing a common **tongue**. " It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single **tongue** being passed around from _mouth_ to _mouth_.;1) [[wzafran](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran)] 16-5-2007(199): What is in a _mouth_ that permits it to speak a _thousand_ things? Yes, a **tongue**.;2) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 16-11-2008(82): A _thousand mouths_ speak the same **TONGUE**.
濃;concentrated;Among other things, the key word refers to the thick consistency of liquids.

This particular ancient chinese Abacus has _eyeballs_ in place of beads, and its frame is made of _bamboo_. You'd be amazed at how fast people can **calculate** with this, especially if they can use _both hands_ at once to move the … _eyeballs_.

襲;attack;_Vase_ . . . _meat_ . . . _slingshot_ (doubled up with) _snake_ . . . _three_ . . . _garment_. The top half of this character is the old form for the kanji in frame 575.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-1-2006(250): The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for "dragon". Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji "imperial dragon". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a _slingshot_ (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our _imperial dragon_ here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare "three-headed slingshot- snake" kept in a _vase_ and fed with _meat_. When the emperor **attack** ed neighbours, his army wore the _imperial dragon garment_.;2) [[jackswitch](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch)] 31-3-2009(99): Fuaburisu's story is incredibly good, but I made it a bit simpler: The _imperial dragon_ is a rare " _three-headed slingshot-snake_ ", kept in a _vase_ and fed with _meat_.

They're invincible creatures!;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 12-1-2006(154): Note : I don't know why James Heisig put "bear" ahead of "ability" (next frame), but I sugget to skip this, learn the next kanji ("ability") then go back here and use _ability_ as a primitive.
嫁;marry into;The kanji in this frame demonstrates the traditional Japanese approach to marriage: it is the _woman_ who leaves her family for another _house_ hold, thus **marrying into** a man's family.;1) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 30-5-2007(188): Since the Nihonjin man is hardly ever home, the _woman_ feels more like she's married into the _house_ than into a relationship.;2) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 16-5-2008(102): Traditionally, it was the _women_ who would **marry into** the _households_ of their husband's families.
策;scheme;_Bamboo_ . . . _belted tree_ (See frame 446).;1) [[Hyland1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1)] 14-10-2006(229): The temples in kyoto belt bamboo around trees in a **scheme** to protect them from the huge number of tourists.

圧;pressure;One of the things that causes the erosion of _soil_ is the excessive **pressure** of the top _soil_ on the lower _soil_. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep _cliff_ without a tree in sight. The **slightest** pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(212): The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous **pressure**.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 4-8-2007(52): For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.
寧;rather;House . . . heart . . . eye . . . spike.;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 31-10-2007(236): A pretty tough kanji. Think of elegant old housewives with English accents dining together at a HOUSE party. The hostess brings out a dish of hors d'oeuvres: a SPIKE of metal with an EYEBALL and a HEART skewered on it. Upon being offered this treat, one of the housewives says in her English accent, "I'd **RATHER** not.".;2) [[saranich](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich)] 25-3-2006(235): **Rather** a house with a heart than an eye with a spike.
専;specialty;_Ten_ . . . _rice fields_ . . . _glue_. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get:  " _Ten rice fields glued_ together. " A **specialty** , of course, refers to one's special " _field_ " of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single **specialty** and usually extend themselves in other _fields_ as well. This is how we come to get the picture of _ten fields glued_ together to represent a **specialty**.;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 17-11-2007(287): After you have chosen your _10_ _fields_ of study, _measure_ how good you are at each to find out your **specialty**.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 7-7-2007(97): 10 brains glued together allows you to specialize in any **specialty** that you want. Imagine each brain having its own **specialty**.
財;property;Clam . . . genie.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 31-10-2007(257): If you're a _money genius_ , you can afford a lot of **property**.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 13-10-2005(116): The keyword refers to **property** in the sense of money or funds rather than of buildings or real estate. Keep this one distinct from frame 193 (“wealth”) and frame 473 (“assets”). Here we have a genie, gulping down oysters. Someone tries to grab an oyster and the genie puts his big arms around his oysters and states his “right of ownership” : “They're mines, my **property**!”.
揺;swing;Fingers . . . condor.;1) [[Elphalpo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo)] 4-9-2008(174): For the _condor_ primitive: A **condor** is like a _vulture_ , but _twice_ as big and it lives near _mountains_ (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For **swing** : I'm sitting on a **swing** when a _condor_ comes by and picks up the whole **swing** set with its big _finger_ -like claws and now I'm **swing** ing in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!;2) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 15-6-2007(141): I keep **swing** ing gleefuly on the talons of the _soaring condor_ until he slices off my _fingers_ and sends me plummeting.

(If you've ever been to Tsukiji fish market, you know what I mean).;2) [[Bullfrog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullfrog)] 27-6-2009(222): This one's easy to remember. The kanji gives 2 examples of foods that should be purchased **fresh**. To remember which foods, take the first letter of **fresh** , "F", to stand for fish and the final sound of **fresh** , "SH", to stand for sheep: **FreSH**. It even puts the primitives in the right order.
防;ward off;Pinnacle . . . compass.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 5-2-2007(207): A giant compass is _The Pinnacle_ 's self- **defense** system. It points in the direction of any invaders so the city is prepared well ahead to **ward off** the intruders.;2) [[Johan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johan)] 28-4-2006(68): To **ward off** enemies, the ancient Greece kept watch from the _Acropolis_ , where they had a clear view in all _directions_.
偶;accidentally;The _person_ on the left is familiar. As for the right side, we may combine the _insect_ with a _brain_ (observe the writing) and a _belt_ to create the _Talking Cricket_ who served as Pinocchio's conscience. ( _The belt_ is there because he pulls it off to give unrepentant little Pinocchio a bit of  "strap" now and again.);1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 23-4-2007(165): _Mr. T_ **accidentially** stepped on _Jiminy Cricket_ (a brainy insect, with a belt sort of sash to hold his "conscience" badge).;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 20-7-2007(69): _Mr. T_ **accidentally** steps on _Jiminy Cricket_. // Primitive: right side: _Talking cricket_ = _Jiminy Cricket_ , a _brainy insect_ with a _belt_ to whip little kids who misbehave.
築;fabricate;Bamboo . . . craft . . . mediocre . . . wood/tree.;1) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 17-10-2007(193): _Bamboo craft_ ing is a _mediocre_ substitute for _wood_ when you are **build** ing or **fabricat** ing a house. While it may look good and might attract a chick (ちく) or two, the kids'll (きず) just tear it to pieces as its not sturdy enough.;2) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 25-7-2007(112): A bamboo fabrication is a mediocre substitute for wood.
誘;entice;_Words_ . . . _excel_. Compare _beckon_ (Frame 702), to _urge_ (Frame 300), _seduce_ (Frame 90), and _encourage_ (Frame 931) when choosing your connotation.;1) [[amthomas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas)] 18-3-2007(596): _Word_ and _Excel_ somehow manage to **entice** people to use them, despite their plethora of bugs.;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 22-12-2009(71): Think of the smooth talker who EXCELS at using WORDS to **entice** women (including married women if it makes it easier to remember).
干;dry;It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to **dry**.;1) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 23-4-2008(168): **Dry** _one_ item in _ten_ minutes on the _clothesline_.;2) [[brose](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose)] 17-2-2007(57): Note: the book shows the strokes for _potato_ rather than **dry** …dry does not have the hook at the end.

Its primitives: _pinnacle_ . . . _anti-_.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 27-8-2007(260): If you're scared of **Heights** , you don't want to stay at _The Pinnacle_ , you are _anti-_ _The Pinnacle_. Primitive: _The Pinnacle_ is a dream-like gated community at the top of a mount. This allows for innumerable stories for all the kanji with this primitive since you have a whole city to work with. Also prevents confusion with "mountain".;2) [[wasurenaide](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide)] 6-12-2007(47): People are being displaced in 大阪 to make room for a new development, Osaka **Heights** , the _pinnacle_ of modern Japanese housing.

潮;tide;Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the _water_  \- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for _morning_ learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word **tide** , just think of it in connection with the character for _eventide_ that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the _morning_ - **tide** , its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(205): The morning **tide** is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.;2) [[Mesqueeb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb)] 19-4-2009(46): If it's not Eventide ( 汐 ) it must be _morning_ **tide**!
操;maneuver;Fingers . . . goods . . . tree.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 14-2-2008(232): Tip: _goods_ \+ _wood/tree_ : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it's worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest " _furniture_ " (a common type of _wooden goods_ ). REF: [parch](../v4/215.html) (#215 燥) , _maneuver_ (FRAME 671), [winding](../v4/1369.html) (#1369 繰), [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻).

This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in [rabbit](../v4/2093.html) (#2093 兎).;2) [[skinnyneo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo)] 7-1-2008(48): What is the rabbit's **excuse** for being such a jerk? Well he was b _ound up for a whole day_ while being stepped on by peoples _human legs_ in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can **excuse** him after knowing that.

(This kanji is almost exclusively used to write 健康 , health).
唐;T'ang;The key word here refers of course to the **T'ang** Dynasty in China (and not to the name of the drink astronauts take with them into outer space, though this could be useful for the next frame). Its elements: _cave_ . . . _rake_ . . . _mouth_.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 2-4-2007(244): Two archeologists are in a _cave_ looking at Chinese artifacts from various eras.

針;needle;In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for _needle_ (on the right) derives. Since we already expect that **needles** are made of _metal_ , let us picture a set of solid _gold_ darning **needles** to complete the kanji.;1) [[gsantise](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise)] 26-8-2007(149): Remember the story of the **needle** in the haystack.

乏;destitution;Drop of . . . building blocks.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 15-2-2008(167): Just one _drop_ (of alcohol) and he starts walking in _zig-zags_ – no wonder _Zorro_ 's living in **destitution**. (Note: As a primitive let 之 be _Zorro_ or _Zig-Zag_ : it's pictographic).;2) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 22-2-2006(132): Children in complete **destitution** have no hope of ever getting toys to play with, so when they find even a tiny _drop_ of a _building block_ they are overjoyed.
略;abbreviation;_Each field_ has its own **abbreviations** (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the  "stronger" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around.;1) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 26-4-2008(200): There are so many **abbreviation** s and acronyms nowadays that no _brain_ can remember _each_ of them.

They tossed him the river and drove off…and after a minute, he bobbed to the top, thanks to his floating _wood_ **pillow**.;2) [[oregum](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum)] 28-6-2010(38): WOODEN **PILLOW** S do not [sink](../v4/1888.html) (#1888 沈) in water.

裕;abundant;This character shows the typical _cloak_ of _valley_ folk, which, unlike the tailor-made, high-fashion overcoats of city folk, is loose-fitting and free- form. Hence the key word's meaning of **abundant**.;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 7-1-2008(325): Again using the fact that cleavage in Japanese is called " _valley_ of the chest": a woman with **abundant** cleavage tightly wraps up her bosom in a form-fitting _cloak_ , but leaving her _valley_ exposed.

He's about to get it out, when you manage to _stop_ the _spoon_ from getting out, so he turns **purple** , as he chokes, and dies.;2) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 1-5-2009(75): Why is your ass **purple**?

The story: a winter morning. A textbook author is holed up in his tiny office, a veritable _cave_. He wants to start his masterpiece textbook by first writing the **preface**. But he can't get started. He sits and stares at empty paper until evening. It gets cold and he puts on _glove_ s, shivering, but still unable to start his **preface**.
獄;prison;Although we did not make note of it at the time, the kanji for _dog_ is also a low-grade term for a spy. And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with _dogs_. The **prison** here depicts a _pack of wild dogs_ (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little c _hihuahua_ (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened _words_.;1) [[f98plow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/f98plow)] 25-5-2007(226): The wild dog family visits their cousin in **prison**.

The West Side is too dangerous.;2) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 8-11-2007(137): [+ skinnyneo] _Spiderman_ visits the _East_ to **practice** his swinging skills. All those Asian cities with skyscrapers and low crime rates make it easy for him to **practice**.

I guess that's ok since raw mammoth can't be too good…;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 28-9-2006(111): This **mannerism** is a _sickness_ of the modern generation.

Scuba divers also know that as you _ascend_ in the _water_ , the **lucidity** of the _water_ improves, too.;2) [[crayonmaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster)] 6-7-2009(26): Lucid dreams allow me to control what is happening. In a drowning nightmare, I forced **lucidity** and allowed myself ascend to the surface.

He seems to really be losing it after coming to the homeless ward…
只;only;When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression "it's the **only** one of its kind. " Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic _mouth_ and two wee _animal legs_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-8-2007(231): Imagine an animal with **only** a _mouth_ and _leg_ s.;2) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 3-5-2008(118): My girlfriend insists that the _only_ thing I want from her is what's between her legs..

(I keep failing this kanji, hopefully this silly story will help me!).
扱;handle;Finger . . . outstretched hands.;1) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 30-8-2007(192): See [suck](../v4/689.html) (#689 吸): if it's too big to **handle** , just use your _fingers_ instead…;2) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 6-10-2007(131): One of the first thing a baby can do with his hand is to _reach out_ and grab your _finger_ as if it was a little **handle**.

隆;hump;This character, used for everything from little **humps** of hills to camel **humps** , easily suggests the hunch on the pig's back and hind parts where the best cuts of meat are to be found (and hence the English expression for luxury, "living high off the hog.") The elements we have to work with are: _pinnacle_ . . . _walking legs_ . . . _cell_.;1) [[jamiemw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw)] 25-9-2007(186): You are struggling to the top across the **hump** s, but you suddenly see the _pinnacle_ and you feel new _life_ in your _walking legs_.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-4-2007(51): A woman takes her _bra_ off and what happens?

Snare is a little generic so I'll use BEAR TRAP, with huge teeth cartoon style that snares you around the ankle. In the _crafting_ of a _bear trap_ , one must be particularly **adroit**. Otherwise they will become the victim of their down device.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 1-1-2007(77): To be _adroit_ one must have mastered the **crafting** of **snares**.

But man, it was worth it!;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(96): On the _road_ to my **interview** I _accidentally_ bump into _Jiminy Cricket_ who gives me some good advice.
厚;thick;When we refer to someone as **thick** -skinned or **thick-** headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for **thick** depicts a _child_ abandoned out on the wild _cliffs_ , exposed to the heat of the _sun_ , and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as **thick** as the parent who left it there.;1) [[potempkin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin)] 26-8-2008(209): The **thick** _cliff_ walls protected the _children_ from the _sun_.;2) [[kfactor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kfactor)] 7-7-2007(142): In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff.

One of the _two husband's_ first job is to fix the _water_ faucet in his new family's apartment. Unfortunately, he isn't very good at fixing things and after a few failed attempts the entire apartment is **submerged** in _water_.
封;seal;Think of the key word **seal** as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax **seal** , you _glue_ a sprig of _ivy_ on the outside. In this way the elements _ivy_ and _glue_ give you a curious and memorable way to **seal** your secret letters.;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 11-1-2006(128): The king used a special **seal** of ivy leaves glued onto his document.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-12-2007(64): A bit of _ivy_ _glued_ to a letter can make a lovely **SEAL** when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart.

As a joke to begin his speech he says, 'Its a **pleasure** to MEAT you all.' (thanx to Shibo  & nestOr).
牧;breed;When it is time to **breed** new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the _cow_ is often not. Thus the _taskmaster_ to the right forces the _cow_ into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can **breed**.;1) [[roderik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roderik)] 21-6-2008(158): Imagine a _taskmaster_ giving a _cow_ the command to "start **breed** ing, and start doing it now!", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to **breed** with. Hence, you see the _taskmaster_ running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the _cow_.;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 26-12-2007(78): Hint: This is the kanji from which _taskmaster_ is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with **breed** , and a lot to do with **pastures** and **shepherds** (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don't differenciate between animals). Think of a _cowboy_ (taskmaster) who brings his _cows_ to the **pasture**.
巡;patrol;A virtual  _flood_ of motorcycle police washing down a _road_ is this kanji's image for a **patrol**.;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(134): The cops don't **PATROL** anymore - they just **flood** the **road**.;2) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 16-11-2007(71): The Venice cops **patrol** on river roads.

裁;tailor;You might think here of _garment_ that have been specially **tailored** for _Thanksgiving_ celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 13-11-2007(191): The **tailor** was hard at work making sure all the pilgrims were dressed in their best _garments_ for _thanksgiving_.;2) [[Buronzu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Buronzu)] 18-7-2009(49): The **tailor** worked hard after _thanksgiving_ to alter _garments_ so they'd fit people who'd eaten too much at their _thanksgiving_ dinners.

Let's call this one Mr. Bean! He's an easy character to build stories with.

管;pipe;Bamboo . . . bureaucrat.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 8-2-2007(299): Japanese _bureaucrats_ send all their messages through an inter-office _bamboo_ **pipe** system.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 12-1-2008(100): "The Japanese internet is a series of bamboo **pipe** s" said one ignorant bureaucrat trying to draft Internet legislation.
汗;sweat;Water . . . dry.;1) [[shaydwyrm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm)] 28-6-2007(203): The way **sweat** is supposed to work: it gets your skin _wet_ , and then as it evaporates/ _dries_ , it cools you off.;2) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 30-8-2006(68): When you **sweat** your clothes become soaked with _water_ , prompting you to hang them to _dry_ on a clothesline.
祝;celebrate;Altar . . . teenager.;1) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 2-8-2008(218): When Japanese people turn 20 they usually visit the _altar_ at their local shrine and **celebrate** no longer being a _teenager_.;2) [[Stormchild](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild)] 19-11-2006(134): It's a Bar Mitzvah. At the _altar_ , the _teenager_ is singing in his awful, mid-puberty voice. We'll all **celebrate** when that part is over!
系;lineage;The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for _thread_ gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, **lineage**.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(281): (Primitive: _DNA_ , a drop of looong spiraled thread that is the key to your **lineage** ).;2) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 6-2-2008(95): Spiderman's **lineage** (who his family is etc…) can be found in his DNA in a drop of blood. The villain that gets blood of Spidey will be able to find out who is family and **lineage** is. be carfefull spidey…
札;tag;The **tags** you see hanging on _trees_ in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of _trees_ they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the **tag** to the branch as a large _fishhook_. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(173): Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing **tag** s on them.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 30-3-2007(69): Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for "Paper Money" w/ the reading さつ ( [千円札＝](midori://search?text=千円札＝) 1000 Yen paper bill)… It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 ("trump" playing cards). For the **tag** meaning I like to think of wooden **tag** s hung on hooks from trees… but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to "hook you in" so to speak.
匠;artisan;Box . . . ax.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-9-2007(178): Most people don't know that one of the most revered **artisan** s in Japan preserves the ancient art of cutting _cardboard boxes_ with an _ax_.;2) [[sarek05](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sarek05)] 3-10-2008(62): The axe murderer considered himself an **artisan** for how his tastefully chopped up his victims and arranged their remains artfully in boxes.
湖;lake;_Water_ . . . _old_ . . . _flesh_. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the _waters_ of a stormy **lake** because their _flesh_ had gotten too _old_ to bear the burdens of life.;1) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 2-8-2007(305): This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the **lake** and looking at the MOON reflected in the **lake**. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.;2) [[DBJ07](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DBJ07)] 17-2-2007(94): Water reflects the old moon in the **lake**.
勉;exertion;_Rabbit_ . . . _muscle_. Notice how the last stroke of _rabbit_ is stretched out to underlie the element for _muscle_.;1) [[onsen_monkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey)] 14-9-2006(149): Notice how BUGS BUNNY's legs (hint about stroke extension) are starting to get big MUSCLES? It must be because he's always EXERTING himself on the run from Elmer Fudd (or from kicking the shit out of Elmer Fudd when he catches up!!).;2) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 8-2-2008(89): Hint: Energizer bunny.
貨;freight;Change . . . shells.;1) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 14-2-2008(185): **Freight** is the _shells_ (money) paid to _change_ the location of something big. Don't confuse with the similar 賃 [fare](../v4/1004.html) (#1004 賃).;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 7-9-2007(97): This is a **freight** train that runs on _spare change_. Imagine getting on the **freight** train with a bunch of _spare change_. You put in some _change_ and it starts up…goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there's actually a slot for _spare change_ and one for regular _shells_. Your call, but it seems to prefer _spare change_ over _shells_.
憂;melancholy;_Head_ . . . _crown_ . . . _heart_ . . . _walking legs_. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of _head_ with the top of the _crown_ serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of **melancholy** figures should offer plenty of suggestions.);1) [[rizzo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo)] 7-2-2006(244): **Melancholy** makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so 'emo'. In order to play up his feelings he bares his _head_ and holds his _crown_ over his _heart_ then walks (on _walking legs_ ) around the palace making everyone see how **melancholy** he is. What a wuss.;2) [[howdycowdy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy)] 24-3-2008(155): This is an image of the crucifixion. Jesus is on the cross. His _crown_ of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his _head_ and his _heart_. His _walking legs_ can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How **MELANCHOLY**!
占;fortune-telling;This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a _divining rod_ with a _mouth_  \- which translate directly into **fortune-telling**. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first _divining rod_ , then _mouth_. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(147): **Fortune-telling** : using a mouth as a divining rod.;2) [[Hikari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hikari)] 27-8-2007(95): A great number of people who do **fortune-telling** are "almost old".
臭;stinking;This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the _St. Bernard_ is alive and well, its _nose_ in the air sniffing suspiciously after something **stinking** somewhere or other.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(172): The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the **stinking** smell comes from.;2) [[ageru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ageru)] 21-1-2008(54): When _I_ is _big_ , Ego **stinking**.

偉;admirable;Person . . . locket.;1) [[johnskb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb)] 1-5-2006(168): Mr. T is certainly an **ADMIRABLE** PERSON, so much so that parents are buying lockets with his picture in it and having their children wear them like amulets.;2) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 21-2-2008(79): For _locket_ : The _locket_ ( _key_ dangling from something, the vertical stroke) opens like a _mouth_ , but you need a jeweler's _monocle_ to make out the pictures within. —– _Dracula_ survives a staking attempt when the _locket_ with Mina's **admirable** picture deflects the blow. "It was an **admirable** attempt," he admits as he sucks his attacker's blood.
砲;cannon;Stones . . . wrap.;1) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 22-9-2007(162): Primitive **cannons** fired _stones_ _wrapped_ with poisonous snakes.;2) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 23-4-2008(131): **Cannon** = _stone_ projectile _wrapped_ by a barrel.

氷;icicle;The appearance of the primitive for _water_ in its full form tells us that we have something to do with _water_ here. The extra _drop_ to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a _walking stick_ dropped into _water_ to form an **icicle**. If it helps, when you hold an **icicle** up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 28-8-2007(238): **Icicle** s start with 1 frozen _drop_ of _water_.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 27-2-2008(73): _A drop_ in temperature turns _water_ into an **icicle**.
嘆;sigh;Mouth . . . scarecrow.;1) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 28-8-2007(245): A **sigh** escapes the _mouth_ of the _scarecrow_ , who laments: "…if I only had a brain, I could learn kanji".;2) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 19-4-2008(155): I will let out a huge **sigh** of relief from my mouth when I learn the last kanji.
貞;upright;Now take the last primitive, the _shellfish_ , and set a _magic wand_ over it, and you have the kanji for **upright**. After all, the _clam_ and the _oyster_ are incapable of walking **upright**. It would take a magician with his _wand_ to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-8-2007(169): A _magic wand_ is needed to make a _clam_ stand **upright**.;2) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 2-5-2008(121): Just the thought of my _magic wand_ on her _clam_ makes my _magic wand_ stand **upright**.
孔;cavity;Probably the one thing most _children_ fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a _child_ has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word **cavity** , even though it is not likely to know that the word means "hole" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny _hooks_ the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.;1) [[ssmoler](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ssmoler)] 21-6-2007(157): The child's arms flailed around at the sight of the hooked tool the dentist was going to use to fill his **cavity**.;2) [[thequietfox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thequietfox)] 20-1-2008(93): I warned him about **cavities** , but the _child_ is still _hooked_ on sweets.
濁;voiced;The key word for this kanji connotes the "muddying" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a "j" is **voiced** while a  "sh" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is **voiced**. The primitives are: _water_ . . . _eye_ . . . _bound up_ . . . _insect_.;1) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 28-6-2007(228): The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing "Help me, Help Me" under the watchful eye of the spider who's venom is dripping like water from her fangs.;2) [[rhclaghorn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn)] 29-12-2007(153): Pour _water_ over the _eyes_ of a _bound up_ _insect_ if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a **VOICED** consanant.
駅;station;Team of horses . . . shakuhachi.;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 17-3-2008(215): Anyone living in Japan knows that train **station** s play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when _horses_ and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his _shakuhachi_ to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next **station**.;2) [[jreaves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves)] 23-7-2007(160): This reminds me of those infamous Mexican porn movies in which shakuhachi is performed on a horse. Here the deed is being done at a train **station**. As the passengers get off, so does the horse.
堅;strict;Slave . . . crotch . . . soil.;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 15-11-2006(267): The **strict** parent thinks adolescent kids are " _slaves_ to their _crotch_ " (= can't control their hormones), so he _grounds_ them. Permanently!;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 30-4-2006(40): **Strict** masters treat even [intelligent](../v4/852.html) (#852 賢) slaves like dirt, and they get no shells.
唱;chant;This one is easy! You have one _mouth_ making no noise (the choirmaster) and two _mouths with wagging tongues_ (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, **chant** , as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 29-6-2007(201): Someone **chant** ing with their mouth open for two consecutive days.;2) [[Tanuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tanuki)] 5-8-2007(50): **Chant** s from our mouths are meant to reach the sun and the stars. Stars are just suns just further away so they seem smaller.
塔;pagoda;On the left we see a mound of _dirt_ , and to the right _flowers_ made to _fit_ together. The two sides combine to create a great **pagoda** made of _dirt_ , with _flowers_ by the tens of thousands _fitted_ together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and _fit_ a few of the _flowers_ in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.;1) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 14-8-2007(165): In order to build a **pagoda** in this small Japanese garden everything has to _fit_ : the _soil_ to the left and the _flowers_ in the upper right corner.;2) [[xeyes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xeyes)] 21-5-2007(48): Pictograph- o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of _soil_ on the left, and a little concrete **pagoda** in the front with _flowers_ behind it. (To my eye, the _fit_ looks a lot like a little **pagoda** anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though…).
曹;cadet;This character is written in the order of its elements: _one_ . . . _bend_ . . . _sun_.;1) [[mikemikepw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikemikepw)] 19-9-2007(166): A space **cadet** eager to make one bend around the sun. (a dangerous maneuver).;2) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 23-12-2008(134): _Bender_ lasted just _one day_ in the space **cadet** s.
率;ratio;_Mysterious_ . . . _sparkler_ . . . _ten_. Do not confuse with _proportion_ (Frame 1673).;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 5-2-2008(152): Keep separate from proportion. _Gandalf_ is trying to adjust the aspect **ratio** of his monitor from 4:3 to 16:9 so that he can watch Lord of the Rings in widescreen format. He's poking around the inside of his monitor with a magnesium _needle_ when he causes a short circuit which sets his needle on fire making the needle look just like a _sparkler_.;2) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 28-9-2006(137): It's quite _mysterious_ how each _sparkler_ gives of sparkles at a precise **ratio** of _ten_ to one. Physicists have been studying this effect for decades, known as the Sparkler Effect, and using it to explain why stars look like sparklers in the night sky.
涯;horizon;After seeing a constant **horizon** of _water_ , _water_ everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ of land on a new **horizon**? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact _ivy_ , but the phrase " _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ " has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(230): Try to reverse Heisig's story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant **horizon** is nothing but water.;2) [[jljzen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jljzen)] 3-1-2009(72): From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the **horizon**.
灰;ashes;The kanji for **ashes** naturally includes the primitive for _fire_ , or more specifically, a _fireplace_. Now what do you do with that bucket of **ashes** you have just cleaned out of the _fireplace_? You walk to the edge of a _cliff_ and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the _fire_ , once it has turned to **ashes** , ends up at the bottom of the _cliff_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(125): The _fire_ underneath the _cliff_ will eventually turn everything above to **ashes**.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 2-2-2008(83): After the cremation _fire_ , many prefer to scatter their loved-one's **ASHES** from seaside _cliffs_.
棄;abandon;_Infant_ . . . _buckle_ (See frame 444) . . . _tree_.;1) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 4-9-2007(274): Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to **abandon** it but it keeps coming back…so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 11-4-2007(74): As in [sash](../v4/415.html) (#415 帯), I treat the _one_ _mountain_ in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan's ichiban mountain). Now we see an _infant_ being **abandon** ed on top of _Mt. Fuji_ well above the _tree_ line to die of exposure.

叱;scold;Recall some particularly harsh **scolding**  you got as a child in school. This character has you _sitting on the ground_  in the corner as your teacher stands over you, her _mouth_  wide open as she reprimands you in front of the entire class.;1) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 20-3-2006(78): A kid gets **scold** ed if they don't put the _spoon_ properly into their _mouth_ when eating.;2) [[Yozora](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora)] 6-9-2009(36): Kids get **scold** ed if they don't open their MOUTH to take their SPOONFUL of medicine.
枯;wither;What makes a _tree_ begin to **wither** up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple _old age_ , as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled _old tree_ , **withering** away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 16-10-2007(189): A tree **wither** s away as it gets old.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 15-11-2007(68): When flowers get old they _suffer_ (frame 225), but _old trees_ just **WITHER** away painlessly. (Picture flowers crying in pain, but a dried up tree silent and sad).
徴;indications;Line . . . mountain . . . king . . . taskmaster.;1) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 23-9-2007(227): If you see a _column_ of _kings_ being marched up the _mountain_ under a _taskmaster_ 's whip… **indications** are, there has been a coup.;2) [[thecite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite)] 14-11-2009(50): The combination of _column_ \+ _mountain_ \+ _taskmaster_ appear in quite a few kanji ( 徴 , 微 ,薇,黴), so let's give it the meaning of ' _trek_ '. Story: If you see kings trekking like peasants, **indications** are they've been outcast.
招;beckon;Finger . . . seduce.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 11-10-2005(204): A Geisha **beckon** s you with her index _finger_ , and as you approach she runs her _fingers_ all over her body in an attempt to _seduce_ you.

暇;spare time;The element for _day_ on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see _staples_ being held in _mouth_ (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's **spare time**. The small _box_ at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly  "inside out." Finally, we have the _crotch_ at the bottom.;1) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 5-4-2007(314): Some jackass-like people have way too much **spare time**. You can find video's of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all _day_.

He later names it "hobby". REF: [shrimp](../v4/2689.html) (#2689 蝦), [haze](../v4/2779.html) (#2779 霞).
邸;residence;Calling card . . . city walls.;1) [[QuackingShoe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuackingShoe)] 22-7-2008(151): So fed up am I, I've finally built _city walls_ around my **residence** to keep these Japanese from soliciting me with their _business cards_.;2) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 28-4-2010(87): The _business card_ says his **residence** is just to the left of the _city walls_.

熟;mellow;The _tall_ and _fat children_ from the last frame are here cast into a cauldron over an _oven flame_ until they have sufficiently **mellowed** that they can return to the normal life of a student.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 28-11-2007(162): Imagine _tall children_ sitting _round_ the _fire_ toasting marsh- **mellow** s.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 4-12-2007(107): The cram school (309) tortures its students - especially the _tall_ and _fat_ ones who need to grow up - over a fire until they **mellow**. (Note that here the keyword 'mellow' only means to mature, ripen, or acquire skill, not the colloquial meaning of 'chill out').
締;tighten;Thread . . . sovereign.;1) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 3-2-2008(174): (astridtops) Spiderman managed to get behind the sovereign. (pick your favourite nowadays country ruler who isn't doing a good job). Spidey has **tighten** d a web around the sovereing's throat. As long as the sovereign says what spidey whispers, he will be fine. Sovereign yelping : ' we will draw are troops back! and we will spend more money on healthcare, schools and less on wars!' Spidey whispering: ' If you continue at this pace, you might be doing good things AND the people will like you.'.;2) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 12-3-2007(98): The _sovereign_ appears to be ruling, but in reality someone behind him (for instance his wife) has a _thread_ around his throat, and if he dares to make a decision she doesn't like, she starts pulling the _thread_ and **tighten** s it around his throat.
暖;warmth;Unlike the character for _warm_ weather learned earlier (Frame 1560), this kanji and its key word can also refer to the **warmth** of human congeniality. Its elements are: _sun_ . . . _migrating ducks_.;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 25-10-2005(240): Ducks migrate south for the winter… they follow the **warmth** of the sun.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 28-2-2008(58): A massive group of _migrating ducks_ is blocking the **warmth** of the _sun_ as they pass over your house/barbecue/picnic. Their formation is so humongous they block the **warmth** for a good 10 minutes while they pass over. Mnemonic for the _migrating ducks_ primitive : the migrating ducks stick together like the best of _friends_ , flying together _as one_ (fifth stroke), they are not easy prey for the _great eagles / vultures_.
葬;interment;_Flowers_ . . . _death_ . . . _two hands_. Do not confuse with _bury_ (Frame 191).;1) [[darg_sama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama)] 3-11-2005(284): I imagine an **interment** as a funeral. At this funeral it's an open casket, and the dead body (death) is holding flowers with both of its hands.;2) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 2-10-2007(74): During the **interment** ceremony, the grandchildren placed _flowers_ over the _dead_ body while the widow sat praying with _two hands_.
稿;draft;The key word connotes the preliminary composition of a plan or manuscript. Its elements: _wheat_ . . . _tall_.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 31-3-2007(235): Aliens often **draft** their plans for invasion by cutting designs among the _tall_ _wheat_.;2) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 2-10-2007(220): The first **DRAFT** of catcher in the rye was actually called "catcher in the TALL WHEAT"…good thing they changed it. I read it in 高校 .
偵;spy;Person . . . upright.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 23-8-2007(213): _Mr. T_ is a terrible **spy**. He walks around _upright_. "Why should I hide?! I've got nothing to be ashamed of!".;2) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 11-12-2006(142): NOTE: The second primitive is _upright_ , not _eminent_. There is an error in the book.

逸;elude;Rabbit . . . road.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 8-1-2006(114): Tip : as a primitive _rabbit_ becomes Bugs Bunny of Looney Tunes fame. Here _Bugs Bunny_ **elude** s Elmer Fudd the hunter, once again.;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 5-2-2008(100): _Bugs Bunny_ **elude** s Elmer Fudd by pretending to be _road_ kill.
敏;cleverness;Behind _every_ successful _taskmaster_ , the **cleverness** of a fox to outwit his charges.;1) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 28-3-2007(167): Every master(or taskmaster) must have some degree of **cleverness**.;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 15-4-2008(73): **Cleverness** is something _every_ _taskmaster_ must have. _Every_ _taskmaster_ has **cleverness**.

課;chapter;Words . . . fruit.;1) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 16-5-2008(229): After I finish each **chapter** of RTK, I eat a piece of _fruit_ to celebrate all the new _words_ I've learned. (Thanks Misha!).;2) [[misha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha)] 26-9-2007(135): _Words_ signify the written words in a book. The _fruit_ represents something whole, complete. A **chapter** in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It's good to disambiguate the keyword from [paragraph](../v4/82.html) (#82 項). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each **chapter** of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you'd very quickly run out of fruit).
県;prefecture;Above, an _eye_ and a _fishhook_ , and below the primitive for _little_. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down ( _eye of a needle_ into _eye_ and _fishhook_ ) if you think it helps.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 6-4-2008(206): In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie's boyfriend. He has lovely blue _eyes,_ a girlfriend who is as thin as a _straightened out fish hook_. But, down where it counts, he has very _little_ to show…;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 9-1-2007(177): After sticking a _fishhook_ in your _eye_ , the yakuza boss probably has _little_ more to do to convince you to move to a different **prefecture**.
曰;sayeth;_Pent in_ . . . _one_. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of _a tongue wagging in the mouth_ that we learned in frame 12. The size of this kanji, a relatively rare one, is what distinguishes it from _day_.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 17-2-2008(148): "Sayeth"?! Who the hell says "sayeth"? Doesn't seem quite right…just like this kanji, which is just like "day" but doesn't seem "quite right.".;2) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 10-4-2008(87): When _pent up_ alone, _one_ **sayeth** little.

The story goes something like this: As a way of providing **consolation** to battle-weary, _heartsick military officers and soldiers_ , the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.).
巨;gigantic;This kanji depicts a **gigantic** "pop-eye," which accounts for its shape. Be sure not to confuse it with the _slave_ ( _retainer_ ) we just learned.;1) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 1-5-2007(342): This is actually the top view of a porn star with a **gigantic** erect penis. The top and bottom are his arms and the middle is his penis. Imagine him making the pumping motion while he's banging some chick. The arms move in, the penis moves out and vice versa.;2) [[thegeelonghellswan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeelonghellswan)] 4-10-2008(130): The letter E, with a **GIGANTIC** middle stroke.
仁;humanity;To refer to the fullness of **humanity** that can only be achieved in dialogue with another ( _person_ . . . _two_ ), Confucius used this character.;1) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 11-5-2008(136): Mr. T shows his **humanity** by giving _two_ bucks to every homeless person he sees.;2) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 21-12-2007(90): **Warning** : This is not **humanity** as in all the people. But rather the qualities that make us human such as compassion and benevolence.
憤;aroused;State of mind . . . haystack . . . clams.;1) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 18-9-2006(250): Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of "indignant". So **aroused** here refers to being **aroused** because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn't seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry _state of mind_ **aroused** at finding all your _clams_ buried under your _haystack_ stolen, gone!;2) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 25-10-2007(68): _Data_ was **aroused/indignant** when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their _haystacks_ and the fishermen collecting their _shells_ . The tragedy of it all **aroused** him so much he didn't even notice he was feeling emotion.
攻;aggression;The special _craft_ of successful _taskmasters_ is their ability to remain constantly on the **aggressive** , never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter- **aggression** of their own.;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 24-2-2008(140): **AGGRESSION** is a well-honed _craft_ for any decent _taskmaster_.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(100): **Aggression** is the _craft_ of a good _dominatrix_.

忙;busy;State of mind . . . perish.;1) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 29-6-2006(224): **Busy** (as in "occupied") means a _state of mind_ where all other thoughts are _perished_.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 28-5-2010(104): ^^^Make the "state of mind" primitive _Data (from Star Trek)_ instead right now and save yourself the headache, 'state of mind' is too vague! ( _Data_ can stay so **busy** as not to sleep without _dying_. He's a robot).
裸;naked;Cloak . . . fruit.;1) [[FudoMyo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo)] 26-4-2007(299): Here we have Adam and Eve eating of the forbidden fruit and realizing they were **naked** , and so clothing themselves in a cloak.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-3-2007(120): Hey honey, I'm **naked** underneath this _cloak_. I've got some nice _melons_ and a fresh _peach_ waiting for you. Don't you want to taste my forbidden _fruits_ …?
鼓;drum;The full kanji for the _drum_ adds a _branch_ , apparently to serve as a **drum** stick, to the primitive for _drum_.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(165): Japanese festivals have **drums** so big, a _samurai_ has to SIT (not stand) on a _table_ to beat one with a tree _branch_! <http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/>~hidafyh/furukawayh/gyouji/image/maturi03.jpg.;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 20-2-2008(41): I really hate the primitive meaning of "table" for "bean." I just use "bean." Anyways, for the **DRUM** primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a **DRUM** with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: "DRUMing on a **DRUM** with a huge BRANCH".
須;ought;_Shape_ . . . _head_. This is the only time that _shape_ is placed to the left of its relative element, the _head_.;1) [[ergerg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg)] 28-7-2006(140): Why, I **OUGHT** to RESHAPE your HEAD…;2) [[Airymon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Airymon)] 15-4-2008(101): Since this Kanji is exceptional, the _shape_ **ought** to be on the left side.

寛;tolerant;The _house_ of _flowers_ or  "hothouse" has become a metaphor for a narrow- minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. **Tolerance** , in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage **tolerance** in those who lack it is first to have them _see_ through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(343): A **tolerant** person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend.;2) [[saruwatari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saruwatari)] 30-12-2007(178): To be **tolerant** is to see flowers (meaning "beautiful things") in every house, instead of looking for drawbacks.

This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL'S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He's probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones **EQUAL** fate on the farm: the kitchen table).;2) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 21-7-2008(97): Put a _box_ over everyone's heads, letting only the _legs_ show, and we all look pretty much **equal**.

We'll call it 'Fireman's **Point** '.;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 4-12-2006(103): This actually means a high mountain. So, to cater to the keyword, it's surely obvious (ahem) that if something gets such a fine title as **Point** , it must be more magnificent than the average mountain. It's as if there was a hill on top of an average mountain, adding to its height.

I'm not a very good cook.;2) [[tcjeff](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff)] 7-6-2008(67): **Char** could be any meat over _oven fire_. So why is it a _turkey_ in this kanji?

Just remember that this kanji refers to those particular **bamboo hats** that are worn primarily by Buddhist monks, who always seem to _stand_ outside of train stations, collecting alms.
脳;brain;_Part of the body_ . . . _owl_ . . . _villain_. By way of exception, the kanji for **brain** has no connection with the primitive for _brains_.;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 8-9-2007(178): The **brain** is the part of the body that can give you the wisdom of the owl… or the wickedness of the villain.;2) [[adhmm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm)] 20-6-2008(44): This villain is really messed up.

協;co-;This prefix should be kept distinct from _inter_ (Frame 222) and _mutual_ (Frame 819).

壊;demolition;The right half of this character shows a _garment_ woven so fine that it can pass through the _eye_ of a _needle_ , fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely **demolishes** them, razing them to the _ground_.;1) [[sannomiya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya)] 3-5-2007(410): If you stand too close to a **DEMOLITION** site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.;2) [[Rakushun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun)] 16-10-2007(108): Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.
沼;marsh;Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the **marsh** lands are low and near a source of _water_ that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes **marshy** is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to _seduce_ the _water_ over to its side. But, like most inordinate _seductions_ , the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy **marsh**.;1) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 19-10-2006(175): The **marsh** lands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water–splash!;2) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 3-2-2008(156): A **marsh** is where _water_ is _seduced_ into the ground.

So i thought of "voodoo doll" but then found "love doll" (which is just a special type of puppet) fit well with these 8 frames. Observe: Here I am **boil** ing my _love doll_ over the _flames_ to warm her up a bit…;2) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 31-5-2006(68): There is a lesser known voodoo practice of **boil** ing a _puppet_ over an _oven fire_ , to really make your victim feel the heat!
肌;texture;Ever notice how the **texture** of your face and hands is affected by the _wind_? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a _part of the body_ gets exposed to the _wind_ , its **texture** is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside **texture** connotes how something is  "to the touch.");1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-2-2007(245): When you expose your _flesh_ to the _wind_ it gets **textured** : goosebumps!;2) [[Rachael](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rachael)] 25-1-2008(136): The _moon_ 's lack of _wind_ preserves its **texture**.

There's a big sign on my front door, and the _words_ clearly say "No **Solicit** ing".;2) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 18-7-2008(62): You can _talk_ until you're _blue_ in the face, but if you're trying to **solicit** me, you're just wasting your time…

They're both _birds_ so its cool.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 8-4-2006(84): A continuation of [mountain stream](../v4/840.html) (#840 渓) (which happens to have the same chinese pronunciation) : the _husband_ who was saved by the _great eagle_ says to his wife that from now on, they will eat **chicken** ! No more fishing hardships and falling in the water.. just raising _birds_. Every now and then the _great eagle_ comes to visit and the man offers one of his **chicken** to the great eagle who had saved his life.
賊;burglar;From a **burglar's** point of view, a _fiesta_ is an occasion to takeout the old lock picking _needle_ and break into the unattended safe filled with the family _shells_ (the old form of money, as we saw in frames 84 and 206).;1) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 11-3-2008(238): **Burglar** s… those guys!!! **Burglar** s only want money (clams) so that they can get needles (drugs) and party (fiesta)!;2) [[twincy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/twincy)] 31-8-2007(71): After the _fiesta_ , we found out that some **burglar** had stolen our _money_ , probably breaking in with a lockpick _needle_ …

虎;tiger;The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the _magic wand_ ) who decided to make a **tiger**. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces ( _diced_ into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated **_tiger_** promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless _human legs_ ). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for _zoo_ (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the **tiger** somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for _zoo_.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 9-4-2007(122): Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt ( 皮 ) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn't like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a **tiger** pelt - but things go awry when the **tiger** promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 23-4-2007(107): **Tigger, the **tiger**** , (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a _magic wand_.

獣;animal;Owl . . . rice field . . . one . . . mouth . . . chihuahua.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 30-10-2006(311): The _owl_ looks for its prey in the _rice field_. It sees so many potential **animal** s to eat but since it only has _one mouth_ , it decides that the tasty looking _chihuahua_ will be its meal for tonight. (adapted from Copycatken,1-9-2006).;2) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 13-10-2007(77): I have a strange story for this one but it works. I imagine a _owl_ getting into a _rice field_ which serves as a boxing ring. His opponent is a little _chihuahua_. The fight starts, the _owl_ takes _one_ punch to the _mouth_ and is out cold. In the _chihuahua's_ corner is that coach from Rocky saying "Your an **ANIMAL**!!". A vivid image of this story works pretty well for me.
爆;bomb;Fire . . . outburst.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 20-6-2007(184): Actually means explosion, like an outburst of fire.;2) [[Piitaa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa)] 11-7-2006(96): **Bomb** s make fiery outbursts. It's almost too logical, this one.
測;fathom;Connoting the measurement of the depth of _water_ , the keyword **fathom** begins with the _water_ primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for _rule_ (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a  "ruler" or "measure." Hence, when we _rule_ _water_ we **fathom** it. What could be simpler? But be careful, its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself **fathoming** a body of _water_ several hundred feet deep by using a _ruler_ of gargantuan proportions.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 11-1-2007(150): A _fathom_ is the unit you use when making **rules** about **water** 's depth.;2) [[XanthosDeia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/XanthosDeia)] 13-7-2008(76): You can't **fathom** how deep this _water_ is. Perhaps you should use a _ruler_ to measure it?
督;coach;Uncle . . . eye.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 1-11-2007(280): Creepy _uncle_ volunteers as gymnastics **coach** so he can _eye_ the team from below.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 28-6-2008(90): Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let's make one story: Your UNCLE was full of [loneliness](../v4/720.html) (#720 寂) ( 寂 ), and he lived by himself. He was naturally [graceful](../v4/721.html) (#721 淑) ( 淑 ) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team. You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he _watched_ over you carefully as [coach](../v4/719.html) (#719 督) ( 督 ). It was uncomfortable, though, how your [uncle](../v4/718.html) (#718 叔) often touched you just _a little above_ the _crotch_ ( 叔 ) when **COACH** ing…

競;vie;Two _teenagers_ are seen here _standing up_ to one another, **vying** for the attention of their peers.;1) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 26-2-2008(158): TWO twin BROTHERS are competing (VYING) for the title of who is the older BROTHER.

Then you lift and the flowers are gone!
胆;gall bladder;The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for _part of the body_ , and on the right, the character for _nightbreak_ , which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the **gall bladder** is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the **gall bladder** is supposed to filter out), and change it to  "not letting the _night break_ on your anger " (or your **gall** ) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then "sleeping it off.";1) [[smiro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smiro)] 11-11-2007(279): The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.;2) [[arturo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arturo)] 20-7-2007(124): All the _month_ long I have to start working at _nightbreak_. This really activates my **gall bladder** (=I get angry).

(not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off). (Adapted from bigloui,12-4-2006).
採;pick;Unlike _pick up_ (Frame 720), this character is used for **picking** fruits from trees. Its elements: _finger_ . . . _grab_.;1) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 14-10-2007(292): You **pick** cheries with your _fingers_ , then along comes a giant _vulture_ and **pick** s up the whole _tree_ with its _claws_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 20-2-2008(87): Tip: _vulture_ \+ _tree_ : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called [grab](../v4/2090.html) (#2090 采). Story: As you go to **pick** your nose, your parent _grabs_ your _finger_ and pulls it away ( & gives you a lecture on social etiquette). REF: "grab" also appears in [vegetable](../v4/734.html) (#734 菜), [coloring](../v4/1714.html) (#1714 彩).
曇;cloudy weather;We refer to days when the _sun_ is covered by the _clouds_ as **cloudy weather**.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-2-2007(248): **Cloudy weather** is when a _cloud_ blocks the _sun_ (up above).;2) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 18-9-2007(17): I have difficulty remembering that the rain is ABOVE the clouds, which is not its logical spot. This is **cloudy weather** , not rainy weather. So I imagine the _sun_ _raining_ down on the _clouds_ instead.
掌;manipulate;Outhouse . . . hand.;1) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 23-5-2007(290): If you're going to **manipulate** your body with your _hand_ , then go do it in an _outhouse_ , at least!;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 21-2-2007(103): Instead of magazines, we keep a Rubiks Cube in the _outhouse_ to **manipulate** with your _hands_ while you do your business.
桃;peach tree;To associate the **peach tree** with the primitive for a _portent_ , recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the **Peach** Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant **peach** , out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named **Peach** Boy.

彫;carve;The two primitives here, _circumference_ and _shape_ , belong naturally to the special connotations that differentiate **carving** from _engraving_ (see frame 1639).;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 29-3-2007(187): Start with a _circumference_ and **carve** away until you get the _shape_ you want.;2) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 18-12-2006(74): [My primitive for _shape_ is Mystique, the shape-shifter from X-Men.] _Mystique_ the shape-shifter **carve** s obscure markings around the _circumfrence_ of her blue body.

隔;isolate;_Pinnacle_ . . . _ceiling_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _glass canopy_ . . . _human legs_ . . . _spike_. You might want to compare the kanji for _dissolve_ (Frame 1123).;1) [[Nuriko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko)] 5-3-2008(113): _The Pinnacle_ , to me, is a city that makes itself out to be perfect but is filled with dirty secrets that photographers are always trying to reveal (see [dissolve](../v4/1044.html) (#1044 融) The city's councilmen have **isolate** d all professional photographers to make sure they don't photograph these "dirty secrets".

隙;chink;_Pinnacle_ . . . _little_ . . . _sun_ . . . _little_. Note that the form of the first element for _little_ given here is the simpler form that has become standard in general-use characters (See Frame 110). For the time being, until typesetting fonts have made the adjustment, the official approved drawing has the drops similar to the bottom _little_.;1) [[to_nihon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon)] 11-1-2009(68): They won't let me in _The Pinnacle_ , but I can see a _little_ bit of _sun_ through this _little_ **chink** in the wall.

災;disaster;Of all of nature's **disasters** , this kanji picks out two of the worst: _floods_ and _fires_. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great _flood_ pouring down over a great forest _fire_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(178): What a **disaster**!

複;duplicate;In its original and etymologically transparent sense, to **duplicate** something means to _double_ it _back_ with a fold, like the fold of a _cloak_.;1) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 14-3-2007(238): My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) outfit at a party, so she doubled back to change!;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 13-8-2007(187): In _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ , Hermione uses a device called a "time-turner" to _double back_ in time, but this creates **duplicate** s.

歓;delight;Again I cannot resist sharing my own associations. If you've ever seen Disney's animated interpretation of classical music, "Fantasia," you will recall what was done there with Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" (the 6th), and the _flying horses_ that figured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather. As dusk sets in, the _flying horses_ all start _yawning_ and pair off for the night: a perfectly **delightful** portrait of **delight**.;1) [[mattoc_g](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g)] 20-4-2006(234): Imagine a spoiled little girl. Her **delight** when she gets a Pegasus for her birthday… and then like all spoilt little girls she gets bored of it quickly… hence the yawn.;2) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 2-11-2007(175): I would be **delight** ed if Japanese lacked the Pegasus kanji.

臨;look to;_Slave_ . . . _reclining_ . . . _goods_. The key word suggests both **looking** ahead **to** something and  "seeing to" what is at hand. Consistent with everything we have learned about the role of the key word, this means that you must choose ONE meaning and stick to it.;1) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 13-6-2006(269): The _slave_ is **look to** the future, "One day" he thinks "I will be able to _recline_ with all my _goods_ , a tv, stereo and washing machine, and when that day comes I shall be truly happy" he sighs.;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 1-5-2007(126): Imagine a slave(or in this case, a female porn star) looking to her new gangbang film where she reclines and gets all 3 holes filled at the same………..OK. Very vulgar, but I was inspired by raulir's clever use of "3 holes"………
漁;fishing;To the story we have just made about _fish_ , this kanji for the profession of **fishing** adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the _water_ , where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten.

I always have trouble remembering that the bonsai tree is on top, so think of them growing on top of the clouds.
補;supplement;Cloak . . . dog tag.;1) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 15-2-2007(192): I usually hear **supplement** in "dietry **supplement** ".

He's riding in a _chariot_ using the foam _finger_ to kill his enemy.
侯;marquis;_Person_ . . . _key_ . . . _dart_. Hint: the pun suggested by the pronunciation of the key word and the primitive for _key_ may come in helpful.;1) [[cb4960](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960)] 14-9-2007(145): _Mr. T_ is made a **marquis** after he and the A-Team save the life of a duke.

弓;bow;This character pictures the bent wooden **bow**. Later we will learn how to make the _bowstring_ that goes with it (Frame 1490).

When you hear the **thunder** , you've got time to get out of the _field_ before it starts _raining_.
鬱;gloom;Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from _melancholy_ (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material _depression_ we met in Frame 1421). The picture of **gloom** begins with a small _grove_ of trees, under which we see a _crown_ made out of used _tin cans_. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of _Remembering the Kanji_. It is composed of a _shovel_ with a _sheaf_ dotted with small _drops_ on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop _shovel_ attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪  "Bulldozing in the _sheaves_ , bulldozing in the _sheaves_... " ♪ The _drops_ represent the chaff flying about as the _sheaves_ are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is _someone sitting on the ground_ alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your _tin-can crown_. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro- business draws closer and closer to the _grove_ , the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re- _shaping_ of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of **gloom** down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.;1) [[mcbainpc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc)] 26-4-2010(76): I'm depressed that this kanji has 29 strokes.;2) [[NeoGlitch](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch)] 1-3-2012(49): In the middle of the GROVE you find a TIN CAN. There's a CROWN inside! You are very excited with your finding, but then a figure appears behind you: "Hey, gimme that kid!" You turn back and it's WOLVERINE, with a SHOVEL on his back and all COVERED IN [rocksalt](../v4/2866.html) (#2866 鹵) "I found that crown in the rocksalt mines over there, so hand it over!" Unless you wanna die, you hand him the crown and he goes away. Then you SIT ON THE FLOOR, feeling impotent, and the SHAPE of your face becomes all **GLOOMY ☹ (The 終 !)**.
環;ring;_Jewel_ . . . _eye_ . . . _ceiling_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _scarf_. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 27-11-2008(253): Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the **ring** ”. First we have a _jewel_. Next we have the _great eye_ of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many _ceilings_ during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the _mouth_ of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”, and Pippin's _scarf_! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 15-12-2007(137): In conjunction with [send back](../v4/837.html) (#837 還)……. When I tried to give her the _jewel_ **ring** , she _eyed_ me, threw it to the _floor_ , opened her _mouth_ and tried to speak, she said nothing. She grabbed her _scarf_ and left.

We tied it up with a **straw rope** , but all that's left of the rope are some torn _threads_ , and the _unbound tortoise_ is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not "eels". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in [waterfall](../v4/537.html) (#537 滝) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as "eels".

宵;wee hours;As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep.

墨;black ink;Besides meaning **black ink** , this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string.

域;range;From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a **range** has also come to mean a grazing _land_ where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming _fiesta_ like that pictured here.

This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for _book_ (Frame 224) and _body_ (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a **tree trunk** , as well as the kanji for _trunk_ (Frame 194).;1) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 12-1-2007(299): A fine _mist_ is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the **tree-trunk** , effectively using the rest of the tree as an _umbrella_ in order to keep _dry_.;2) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 10-5-2007(64): By astridtops - In the rainy _mist_ , Totoro is standing in front of a **tree- trunk** at the bus stop, under the _umbrella_ he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains _dry_! Great story…which I get to by thinking: **tree-trunk** -> **TT** - > **T** onari no **T** otoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.
履;footgear;Flag . . . restore.;1) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 10-4-2009(206): NOTE: The most common use is in はく, meaning to put on **footgear** , rather than actual **footgear** itself. STORY: You are asleep in camp when you are woken up with news that the FLAG has fallen to the enemy. You quickly PUT ON YOUR **FOOTGEAR** and run off to RESTORE the FLAG.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 21-9-2006(105): You should never use a _flag_ as a shoeshine cloth to _restore_ your **footgear**.
圏;sphere;This key word refers to a realm or orbit, not to a ball. Its elements: _pent in_ . . . _scroll_.;1) [[ivoSF](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF)] 9-9-2006(156): I assosiate scrolls with spell casting, the efect of this spell is pent in a certain **sphere** of influence, outside it no damage is done.;2) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 10-2-2008(115): [RPG] You're fighting a powerful enemy. Your mage uses a _scroll/quartersnake_ of protection, and he's _pent in_ a **sphere** of protection.
蒸;steam;The _flower_ at the top and the _floor_ with the _oven fire_ beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for _complete_ , whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of _water_.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 31-12-2005(181): This kanji is used in compounds for the **steam** ing of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist, **steam** ing food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be _completely soaked in water_ , and then poured over a thin piece of _flooring_ under which there is an _oven fire_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 25-3-2008(136): Note: _complete + water + floor_ are later combined into 丞 [helping hand](../v4/2919.html) (#2919 丞). Story: The driver of a **steam** train asks you for a _helping hand_ and explains that your job is to throw _flowers_ on the _fire_ to make the **steam**.
慶;jubilation;_Deer_ . . . _crown_ (note the doubling up) . . . _heart_ . . . _walking legs_. You may recall that we met the relative primitives at the bottom here before, in the kanji for _melancholy_ (Frame 663).;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 12-1-2006(112): In this kanji, " _deer_ " replaces the "head" primitive from the "melancholy" kanji. Poor Ned is feeling melancholy so Uncle Jimbo (of South Park animated series) suggests a good _deer_ huntin' trip to fix that and turn that _melancholy_ into **jubilation**.;2) [[adrianbarritt](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt)] 5-9-2007(96): _Bambi_ was _melancholy_ at the death of his mother, but is now in **jubilation** as he's made friends with thumper.
昌;prosperous;What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning "everywhere" or "heaps of" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see _two suns_ , one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the _three suns_ of _sparkle_. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of **prosperous** times as _sunny_ , what could be more **prosperous** than a sky with _two suns_ in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there.;1) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 25-9-2006(469): If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be **prosperous**.;2) [[cutiehuni](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cutiehuni)] 14-2-2009(76): I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like 'fortune', so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from 'Star Trek' (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase 'live long and PROSPER'? If that's not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.
妖;bewitched;You are **bewitched**  by a _woman_ who is, of course, a _witch_.;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 19-2-2007(56): If you don't want to get **bewitched** (and who would?), then avoid any _woman_ you see carrying what might appear to be a _sapling_. It's really a wand in disguise, and if you're not aware you might get **bewitched**.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 12-10-2008(26): I was **bewitched** by the _woman fairy_ (like an angel, but not as tall).
鍵;key;The _golden_ **key** you have been presented by the mayor gives you access to all the _buildings_  in the city.;1) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 16-2-2007(99): The _metal_ thing you need in order to enter things you _build_ is a **key**.;2) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 5-11-2010(15): 鍵盤 [key](../v4/2761.html) (#2761 鍵) ケン, かぎ … Parts: 金 , 建 (cf 建物 [build](../v4/391.html) (#391 建), 健康 [healthy](../v4/974.html) (#974 健)) … Story: The most important _Metal_ in any _build_ ing is the **lock** on the front door, and without a **key** you ain't getting in. This kanji means both lock and **key** to most Japanese people. 錠前 is technically the word for lock but it's not used in daily conversation.
汁;soup;To make **soup** , one begins with _water_ and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick **soup** or stew called  "seven-in-one" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a _ten_ -ingredient **soup**.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(169): To make **soup** you just take _water_ and _add_ (+) the rest of your ingredients.;2) [[ostracon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ostracon)] 4-12-2007(158): To make **soup** you just take _water_ and _add_ _ten_ tasty ingredients.
盆;basin;Part . . . dish.;1) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 17-6-2006(254): The _part_ of the kitchen sink in which you wash _dishes_ in is the **basin**.;2) [[crayonmaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster)] 5-4-2009(53): Your mom yells at you to stop throwing dishes in the **basin**. She lifts up (to show primitive order) the broken parts to show you the damage you've done.
霜;frost;Think of **frost** as a cooperative venture, an _inter_ -action of the malevolent forces of _weather_ that sit around a conference table and finally decide to allow a very light amount of moisture to fall just before a short and sudden freeze.;1) [[johnskb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb)] 5-3-2006(154): **FROST** is kind of an _inter_ - _weather_ , phenomenon, something between rain, snow and freezing temp’s.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 5-9-2008(75): The freezing RAIN formed **FROST** on the TREE right before your EYES. If you want, **frost** -y then think **Frost** Tree to get to the mnemonic. SECOND STORY: **FROST** Y the snowman? It's RAIN that **FROST** S that can then INTER-act with the kids, till he melts of course.
距;long-distance;Wooden leg . . . gigantic.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 20-12-2007(200): You can step a **long-distance** if you have a _leg_ that's _gigantic_!;2) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 14-4-2008(117): You can step a **long-distance** if you have gigantic wooden legs (stilts).
譲;defer;Words . . . grass skirt.;1) [[jreaves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves)] 12-7-2007(150): (thanks chamcham) A graduate student in anthropology tells the University that he plans to **defer** his studies for a year, and instead conduct "field research" on the grass-skirt-wearing native women on the island of Jou.;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 6-1-2008(128): The islanders **defer** to the _word_ s of their chief Jou in his _grass skirt_.

So imagine a guy trying a cocktail ( _water_ ), feeling like he's been kicked in the face ( _footprint_ ) and _sparks_ are flying from his tongue. 'How did it taste?'. 'Hmm, yes, slightly bitter, but fresh".
亜;Asia;In this kanji, the abbreviation for **Asia** , you should be able to see the character for _mouth_ behind the Roman numeral II.;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 26-9-2007(279): In **Asia** n countries, people use _II_ chopsticks to get things into their _mouths_. Just imagine someone shoving a piece of sushi into their mouths with chopsticks.;2) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 25-6-2007(86): A mouth barred up and not aloud to speak freely is the sign of **asia** (korea, China, pakistan etc).

汰;cleanse;This character can mean both to **cleanse** and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly _plump_ going to a skinny spa whose medicinal _waters_ promise to **cleanse** him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the _water_.;1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn't find any reference to this kanji as meaning **cleanse**. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to 'select' so maybe Heisig meant **cleanse** in the ethnic sense here.. I'm going to use the keyword "selection", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 24-7-2009(27): _Water_ is used to **cleanse** a _plump_ man's colon.

籍;enroll;Bamboo . . . Christmas tree . . . once upon a time.;1) [[cb4960](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960)] 14-9-2007(266): _Once upon a time_ , in order to **enroll** in a Christian school you had to answer a series of questions to ensure that you were really Christian.

肯;agreement;Seeing _footprints_ on someone's _flesh_ indicates a rather brutal way of having secured that person's **agreement**.;1) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 24-1-2006(176): A secret **agreement** between a covert gov't agency and aliens states that we will not step _foot_ on the _moon_ again in return for alien technology.;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 21-12-2007(118): NASA and Armstrong made an **agreement** : They'd never tell anyone that no-one actually stepped _foot_ on the _moon_.

漠;vague;Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are **vaguely** discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true _graveyard_. The _water_ may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate **vagueness** with the _graveyard_ and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 3-8-2007(263): The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are **vague**.;2) [[jjazz_kanji_first](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jjazz_kanji_first)] 12-4-2007(147): The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is **vague**.

The explanation makes "sense," but is hard to remember because the word " _beginning_ "is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all **stubbornness** goes back to the _beginning_ , with two brothers each **stubbornly** defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled _heads_ , each vying for the favors of heaven, a **stubborn** grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 26-8-2007(273): A **stubborn** person in the _beginning_ gets something into their _head_ and can't change their mind.;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 16-11-2007(186): Picture a **STUBBORN** schoolboy, with his arms crossed and his book still open to the BEGINNING PAGE.

鎖;chain;_Metal_ . . . _little_ . . . _shells_. We have saved this character until no win order to draw attention to the visual difference between the _owl_ and _little_.

均;level;The **level** this key word refers to is not the carpenter's tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures _soil_ being scooped up into a _ladle_ and then made **level** (apparently because one is measuring _soil_ ).

胴;trunk;The word **trunk** refers to the _part of the body_ that is left when you have " **truncated** " all the limbs.

This mnemonic is meant to join RtK's keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used " **elegant** " here, which is not confounded so easily with [graceful](../v4/721.html) (#721 淑), and accurately represents the character's meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary).;2) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 5-4-2007(47): To not confuse it with [grace](../v4/606.html) (#606 恩) or [graceful](../v4/721.html) (#721 淑), think of the phrase "Goodness **gracious**."

Their _twisted_ eyes have lost the _heart_ of the **constitution**.
鎮;tranquillize;The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of _metal_ to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked.

喚;yell;The _mouth_ on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: _four St. Bernard dogs bound up_ in a bunch.

Here, we see four _St Bernard dogs_ all **yell** ing for a chance to play a part in Old **Yell** er. They're so loud that you have to _bound_ them, and their _mouths_ , up.

冒;risk;Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the _sun_ for fear you might burn out your _eyes_?

Pull it out —–yes! Success!
砕;smash;We begin with the two elements on the right, _baseball_ and _needle_. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a _game of cricket_ in which a _needle_ is laid across the wicket.

梢;treetops;As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing _candles_ to the branches of evergreen _trees_ , it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs.

輸;transport;On the left we see a _vehicle_ used for **transport**. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for _meeting_. Below it we see the elements for _flesh_ and _saber_ , which combine to create a compound element for a _butcher_ and his trade. Together they give us the image of a  "trucker's convoy.";1) [[jmadsen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen)] 17-12-2005(219): The _car_ is a cattle-car, used to **transport** animals for the _butcher_ 's _meeting_ \- a convention on new butchering techniques.

Usually good **stocks** are referred to as  "blue chip," but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color _vermilion_ , perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves.;1) [[cellophane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane)] 12-10-2007(306): Which _tree_ would you buy **stocks** in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one _vermilion_ leaf left on the right?;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 2-3-2007(145): Ideally, one buys **stocks** when a company is young, "green," and rapidly growing – then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins.

葛;kudzu;**Kudzu**  is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the "plague of the South." From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, _flowers_  and _siesta_  into a memorable image.;1) [[abaddon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon)] 17-5-2008(78): Flower, siesta: The muchacho was not careful.

[ **Note:** I assume those 2 reports are to warn against possible confusion with [poem](../v4/346.html) (#346 詩) but how can you confuse _Vogon poetry_ with an actual _poem_? Anyway, it's the next frame, so it should be easy to keep them straight… Or maybe there's a kanji for _Vogon_ in RTK3?].
僚;colleague;_Person_ . . . _pup tent_. Choose some connotation of the key word that will keep it distinct for you from _companion_ (Frame 19), _friend_ (Frame 760), _consort_ (Frame 1287), and _comrade_ (Frame 1765).;1) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 18-6-2009(134): Trivia: The right primitive is _kagaribi_ \- 尞 - _fuel used for sacrifices_. I would use _sacred bonfire_ as a primitive . (Mnemonic: Top is a merged image of _big_ and _fire_ \- _big sacred bonfire_ that looks like _little sun_ ).

The silhouettes are usually the same, but one will decidedly be wearing a _garment_ in the shape of a **SKIRT**. Also, we've already learned the kanji for "woman", so if the signs are only in kanji you have no right to wander in and claim ignorance, perv!

胃;stomach;You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: _flesh_ ( _part of the body_ ) and _brain_. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the _part of the body_ that keeps the _brain_ in working order is the **stomach**. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the _brain_ as being  "held up" by the _flesh_.;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 27-8-2007(321): The _rice field_ is harvested once a _month_ to get food for our **stomach**.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 21-7-2006(41): The **stomach** is the part of the body that digests food (which, in Japan, is mainly rice).

Reasons: (1) _Toilet paper/roll_ usually comes on a _spool_. (2) _Toilet paper_ is used to clean the _soil_ off your _crotch_.

羨;envious;_Sheep_ . . . _water_ . . . _yawn/lack_.

Assuming that 99% of you guys use the age old story of a 'sun rising through a tree tells you were the east is', back in those days when people used **ridgepole** s they wanted to align their houses in such a way that they face the rising sun, so they wake up with a bright day, and wake up early with the sun seeping through in a perpendicular manner( as the ridge pole faces the sun in the morning).
升;measuring box;This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a _thousand_ sharp _needles_ , and the quaint little **measuring box** becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of _thousand_. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.;1) [[solarmist](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/solarmist)] 26-6-2008(393): It is a thousand or ten? I need my **measuring box**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(120): I can fit a thousand needles into my **measuring box** , but only if I bend the thousand.
契;pledge;_Grow up_ . . . _dagger_ . . . _St. Bernard dog_. The connotation of this character should be kept distinct from that for _vow_ (Frame 1214) and _promise_ (Frame 1462).;1) [[frozach](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frozach)] 18-10-2007(164): Imagine a totalitarian regime where, while _growing up_ , you have to **pledge** allegiance to the flag at _dagger_ -point and with _St. Bernard_ guard dogs watching you.;2) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 27-5-2008(81): With our new pills we **pledge** to _grow_ your _dagger bigger_ \- typical junk mail.

塾;cram school;**Cram schools** are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the _tall children_ who are out on the school _grounds_ practicing sports, and the _fat_ ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the **cram schools** , rather than those who do.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 12-1-2007(286): Welcome to our **cram school** : you will _receive_ a _rounded_ education on our _grounds_.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 6-11-2007(71): "You can _receive_ a well- _rounded_ education if you study at our **cram school** " says the advertisement.

貼;post a bill;The key word in this frame has do with **posting bills** to a billboard. In this case, the billboard is standing at the exit to a Chinese restaurant displaying the latest alternative to the tradition _fortune-telling_ cookies. Look closely and you will see rows of leftover shells of _clams_ with little slips of paper sticking out of them **posted** to the billboard.;1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 12-11-2008(43): Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to **affix** it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true. Picture licking the back of the shell like a stamp and **affix** ing it to the fortune.;2) [[CasualTatsumaki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki)] 7-5-2010(25): To prevent confusion with [affixed](../v4/1303.html) (#1303 附) I changed this to "paste (v.)" or "cut and paste" because it is the character for pasting in a PC and in graphic design. Careful [paste](../v4/2650.html) (#2650 糊) Story: You pay money and the fortune teller cuts and pastes a good fortune and prints it out for you on his notebook PC. 切り貼り きりはり cut and paste, 貼る はる to stick/to paste, 貼付け はりつけ (computer file) paste.
朴;crude;As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's _wand_ out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the _wood_. For the magic of the _wand_ derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its **crude** , natural state.;1) [[simple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/simple)] 12-9-2007(153): _Wooden wands_ are the **crudest**.

貯;savings;To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of **savings** as actual money.

The _nail_ under the roof of the _house_ points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's _shells_ for safekeeping.;1) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 9-10-2007(158): It takes a lot more than one _clam_ of **savings** to buy a _house_ on a _street_.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 17-6-2008(68): My **SAVINGS** plan - I _nail_ my _money_ bags up in the rafters below my _roof_.

Hear his scream?;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 8-4-2006(92): A husband who went fishing at the **mountain stream** to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we'll assume this is a large **mountain stream** ).

From that point on they stuck in Japanese people's mind's as durable and high quality. (True story).

Here they lay, under a big _cross_ , their _mouths_ side by side. I stick _hairpins_ in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin.

What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 7-1-2007(69): The "E" shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!).

桐;paulownia;Since you probably don't know what a **paulownia** _tree_ is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase  "the Little Brothers of St. **Paulownia.** " It is a short step to associate the _tree_ with the _monks_ to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental _tree_ really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.);1) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 29-3-2007(371): In Japan, a **paulownia** (きり）is known as the "princess tree".

克;overcome;In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of _teenager_. The _needle_ on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the _teenager_ growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the _needle_ at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that "We Shall **Overcome** " the plague, will the _needle_ cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character.;1) [[wfreeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wfreeman)] 3-2-2007(184): Ten elder brothers can **overcome** anything.;2) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 1-8-2008(81): A **teenager** addicted to heroine must **overcome** the _needle_.

When you take visiting **relatives** to a _parade_ , hold the _little_ ones _up above_ so they can see over the crowd.
項;paragraph;To the right we see a _head_ and to the left an element that means _craft_. When we think of a **paragraph** , we immediately think of a _heading_ device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate _heads_ often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's _craft_. Hence, we define **paragraphing** as the  " _heading craft_ " to remember this character.;1) [[crazy88](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crazy88)] 19-9-2007(237): To write a **paragraph** is the _craft_ of grouping sentences on a _page_.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 5-2-2008(115): To _craft_ a _page_ well, we need **paragraph** s.

You need drier wood.;2) [[jamestaverner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamestaverner)] 23-2-2008(29): Still giving _flowers_ to that special woman in your life? That's so last year. Everyone knows now with the price of **fuel** that / " **Firewood** is the _new_ _flowers_ " / Go on, get some **firewood** today and make her Valentine's Day dreams come true.

Just imagine factory workers scraping out the **intestines** of real piglets and packaging them up for little children.;2) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 30-5-2007(144): Taking things too literally, you used a real _piglet_ as a _piggy bank_. Now when you smash it open to get your coins out, you have to dig out your coins from its **intestines**. ew.
呈;display;The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: "Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the _king_?

These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, "the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April", "a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month."].

However I had problems remembering that the _insect_ primitive goes on the left. If you have similar difficulties, try this: **rainbow** is an _Insect-Craft_.

(I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in _Once upon a time_ , their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).;2) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 8-2-2008(119): " _Once upon a time_ …" Oh hell, you're just too old for this.

萎;numb;Flowers . . . committee.;1) [[wrightak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak)] 31-3-2009(51): The keyword **numb** makes no sense. I choose 萎む （しぼむ）" **to fade away** ".

A photo is taken every day showing this scene and a time lapse video shows the wheat growing through the year until the wheat is tall and the top sprouts to look like its _flowers_. At this point, the girl can no longer be seen in the photos and she **fades away**.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 22-1-2009(35): Any FLOWER that will make you go **NUMB** is likely to be banned by the olympic COMMITTEE.

傲;arrogance;_Person_ . . . _soil_ . . . _compass_ . . . _taskmaster_.

勅;imperial order;In order to keep this character distinct from that for an _imperial edict_ (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun. Think of the **order** here as a mail **order** or an **order** of pizza phoned in by the Emperor for delivery to the **imperial** palace. Then it will not be hard to put together _bundle_ and _muscle_ to form a story about an **imperial order**.;1) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 9-12-2007(248): This is an **imperial order** for pizza.

茎;stalk;Flower . . . spool.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 18-2-2008(196): Suggestion: Replace "spool" with "toilet paper/roll". Reasons: (1) _Toilet paper/roll_ usually comes on a _spool_. (2) _Toilet paper_ is used to clean the _soil_ off your _crotch_. Story: Just get a _flower_ and carefully wrap some _toilet paper_ around its **stalk**.

Nice pic mspertus!
圭;squared jewel;Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, **square jewel** , depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of _soil_ on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 9-10-2005(166): Piling _SOIL_ upon _SOIL_ for aeons is how **SQUARE JEWEL** S are formed deep in the earth.;2) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 14-4-2008(62): How would you stop someone stealing your biggest **square jewel**? Bury it deep in the _soil_ under _ground_. Then plant _ivy_ to mark the spot.
韓;Korea;As with _Italy_ (Frame 1245) and _Africa_ (Frame 1391), this character simply abbreviates the full name of _Korea_. Its elements: _mist_ . . . _locket_.;1) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 21-9-2006(174): There's a young **Korea** n male actor, Yon-sama, famous amongst middle-aged Japanese women. Extremely famous. Read about his affect on Japan/ **Korean** relations on Everything2.com. In any case, women just flipped over this guy, traveled to **Korea** to see his home, started taking **Korea** n language classes, etc. So, imagine here the _misty_ eyes of the Japanese women as they clutch their _lockets_ with Yon-sama's picture inside watching his **Korea** n romantic mini series called "Winter Sonata".;2) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 27-9-2007(113): This character represents the flag of South **Korea** : a _locket_ (circular taegeuk) in the middle of the _mist_ (white background). <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_South_Korea>.

It's good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count **vessels**.
繕;darning;Thread . . . virtuous.;1) [[joesan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan)] 8-11-2007(200): After a day being _virtuouos_ and keeping the city safe, _Spiderman_ 's outfit is in need of some repair. Luckily, as he can shoot out threads **darning** is very easy for him to do.;2) [[Rakushun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun)] 7-7-2007(60): **Darning** is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it.
寡;widow;_House_ . . . _head_ . . . _dagger_. Immediately we get another instance of a very odd exception. Notice how the final stroke of the head is lengthened, giving the final two strokes a chance to stretch out and make room for the _dagger_ that fits in beneath.;1) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 26-5-2007(295): The new **widow** sits in the _house_ , her _head_ in her lap (the extended stroke), her _dagger_ in her husband.;2) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 28-7-2007(49): The _house_ 's _head_ , her husband, was murdered with a _dagger_. You can still see the drops of blood above the dagger. She is now a **widow**.
昆;descendants;By _comparing_ apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have **descended** from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything **descended** from everything else, one way or another, means that there is  "nothing new UNDER the _sun_.

燥;parch;**Parch** ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial **parch** ment from _wood_ pulp. The _fire_ at the left and in the  "strong" position serves to remind us of the root word, " **parch** ," since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like _fire_. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a  " _wood-good_ ,"), wet it, and hold it over a _hearth_ in your mind's eye. Now watch as it **parches** the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling **parch** ment.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 14-2-2008(273): Tip: _goods_ \+ _wood/tree_ : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it's worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest " _furniture_ " (a common type of _wooden goods_ ). REF: _parch_ (FRAME 215) , [maneuver](../v4/671.html) (#671 操), [winding](../v4/1369.html) (#1369 繰), [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). Story: It's been so **parch** ed recently that your _furniture_ suddenly catches _fire_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(76): The **parch** ment says you need _fire_ to make _good_ s from _tree_ s.

Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested _wheat_ on a _shelf_ in order to pay the **tariff** to his lord.
簿;register;Bamboo . . . water . . . acupuncturist.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 19-1-2006(213): Note : the keyword is not a verb, think of a record book. This _acupuncturist_ who uses _bamboo_ in place of flowers to dilute _water_ into his patients (see frame 227), managed somehow to appear on the **register** of acupuncturists. Chances are, he won't stay on the **register** for long. My image is close to that of gorgon's story.;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 29-1-2006(106): This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD) **register**. Pumping that much water into a body can be dangerous, see the huge bamboo stems with gallons of water sloshing in and out of the patient.
惰;lazy;_State of mind_ . . . _left_ (i.e.  "sinister") . . . _flesh_.;1) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 10-5-2007(448): When I am in a **LAZY** _state of mind_ I use my _left_ hand to play with my _meat_ …it feels like someone else is doing it, which is good cause I'm to **lazy** to get a date.;2) [[iheckman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iheckman)] 27-5-2008(174): When in a **lazy** state of mind, the things you need to do are left for next month.

He looks at you funny when you hand him a **ticket** already torn in half. He quietly tears the stub into _quarter_ s after you show him your _dagger_ with a smile.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 7-5-2007(28): In Japan, the JR railway ju-hachi-kippu seasonal discount **ticket** can be cut into _quarters_ with a _dagger_ and shared with your friends.

But I told him no way, since that's cheating. Besides, I'm just **reviewing** things I already know. I won't fail. But he kept insisting, so I kicked him and sent him crashing through the entrance _gates_.
奨;exhort;_Leader_ . . . _St. Bernard dog_. Do not confuse with _urge_ (Frame 300).;1) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 21-8-2007(213): It's easy to picture a LEADER that uses a BIG dog to **EXHORT** his people to do more.;2) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 1-5-2009(96): Here we have a _St.Bernard_ **exhort** ing the vulture to become the _leader_ in the race against the turtle, but he can't because of the glue. see [leader](../v4/731.html) (#731 将).

Think of **sticky** as in **sticky** mochi paste, which is traditionally made by dropping rice in a bucket and pounding it with a mallet. So, you have the rice on the left, and on the right you have the mallet poised over the bucket. Nuff said.
勃;uprising;If you think of the _ten_ as a little  "cross" sitting atop the root of a _house_ where we are used to seeing the  "chimney" ( _drop_ ), then you have the image of a _chapel_.

累;accumulate;_Rice field_ . . . _threads_. Make use of the position of the elements to distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame.;1) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 19-9-2007(160): (dingomick) _Venom_ is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to **accumulate** as many _brains_ as he can, snatching them out of people's heads and storing them on top of his own, till there's just one massive _brain_ on top of his head!;2) [[Mighty_Matt](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mighty_Matt)] 22-2-2008(140): When you **accumulate** knowledge in your _brain_ , neural pathways are constructed. All those pathways end up like a huge ball of _thread_ tangled together. The more knowledge you **accumulate** the more _threads_ you throw into the mix!!

The _mysterious_ origin of this part of a _boat_ comes from the strengthened sides of warships that used artillery (it means "gun ridge").
岬;headland;Like the _cape_ (Frame 164) and the _promontory_ (Frame 840), the **headland** refers to a jut of land. Its elements: _mountain_ . . . _roots_.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-3-2007(206): A **headland** is a _mountain_ that is firmly _rooted_ despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water.

(Gibralter, for example, is basically an _armoured mountain_ ).

Picture them jumping out of trees instead of being hurled from Lakitu. Lakitu - is the guy who flys the cloud in the Mario games…
駐;parking;Team of horses . . . candlestick.;1) [[ithil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ithil)] 5-4-2007(133): **Parking** in the dark may be difficult…specially if you're **parking** a _trojan horse_. To lend you a tiny bit of help, take this _candlestick_ with you, and at least you'll have some light.;2) [[sweetneet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet)] 21-1-2007(63): In the olden days **parking** lots used to have reserved spaces for where the _lord_ (of the set of houses, shops, whatever) could park his _team of horses_. nowadays it's pretty much the same…reserved **parking** in front for the big bosses' cars….
貿;trade;_Receipt_ . . . _dagger_ . . . _shells_. Though the meanings are related, do not confuse with _make a deal_ (Frame 471) or _wholesale_ (Frame 1499).;1) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 3-5-2007(188): There's a buyback program where you can **trade** in your _dagger_ for _money_. But it's quite ineffective, since only registered dagger-owners with the _original receipts_ can participate, and not criminals with illegally-purchased daggers.;2) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 8-11-2007(74): The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to **TRADE** the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.

He's trying to **BREAK** his MORTAR by throwing it to the SOIL. Whoa! Now he's aiming a MISSILE at it!;2) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 17-9-2007(40): To " **break** the _soil_ " is to make a symbolic gesture that indicates the beginning of construction. Like when a politician in a hardhat gets a shovel and lifts a piece of dirt. This particular project is behind schedule, so to speed things up, they blow it up with _mortar_ and an air-to-ground _missile_.
窃;stealth;Hole . . . cut.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-5-2006(184): This more commonly means "steal", like how a thief _cuts_ a _hole_ to steal the jewels.;2) [[Howdoken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken)] 14-4-2008(97): The word **STEALTH** makes me instantly think of Solid Snake, who CUTS a HOLE in a cardboard box so he can peer out of it.
賦;levy;A certain portion of _shells_ (money) is collected by the _warrior_ from the local villages as he passes through to defray the costs of keeping the land safe, and this is called a **levy**.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 7-8-2007(167): A _warrior_ stands guard at a bridge collecting _shells_ as a **levy** for any who want to pass.;2) [[lb4269](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lb4269)] 28-2-2006(69): "Drove my Chevy to the **levy** but the **levy** was dry.

Who is to blame? **Bond**. James **Bond**.;2) [[mikedough2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2)] 20-1-2008(143): [bond, loan, debt] _Mr. T_ buys a lot of high risk **bond** s and then _blames_ his broker when they all plummet in value.
臼;mortar;The image here is of _back-to-back staples_.

I think you can imagine something else is done to **captive** women…;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 2-8-2007(104): Tip: To avoid confusing keyword _captive_ with [captured](../v4/1018.html) (#1018 囚) note that cap _ti_ ve contains " _ti_ " for _ti_ ger.
穫;harvest;_Wheat_ . . . _flowers_ . . . _vessels_.

(Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji ( [口＋兪](midori://search?text=口＋兪) ) and the simplified form ( [口＋俞](midori://search?text=口＋俞) )) .
肢;limb;Part of the body . . . branch.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-10-2005(237): The **limb** s that this kanji represents are _parts of the body_ that are connected to the trunk, like the main _branches_ to a tree (“arms and legs” is the second meaning of this kanji).

厘;rin;No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One **_rin_** is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something  "very, very tiny."

亘;span;"Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..." goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof.

See them held in cells for 10 days (a decameron) before being fed to the lions. They appear before the chanting Roman crowds as _bones_ to be devoured.

旺;effulgent;The radiant, **effulgent** splendor of he _sun_ makes it _king_ of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don't take this too abstractly, picture the _sun_ seated on a throne, flourishing its _scepter_ this way and that.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 7-6-2007(60): The _Sun King_ (Louis XIV) was known for his **effulgent** reign.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 2-8-2008(19): [+katsuo] This is the _Sun King_. Sayeth Wikipedia: "The _Sun King_ (in French le Roi Soleil) because of the idea that, just as the planets revolve around the _Sun_ , so too should France and the court revolve around [the _king_ ] ("<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France>).

衷;inmost;Between the _top hat_ and the _scarf_ you will see the character for _in_ which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the _scarf_. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the _in_ (the _walking stick_ in the _mouth_ ) was set on its side, here it is set upright.;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 17-7-2007(267): The guy from [pathetic](../v4/401.html) (#401 哀) shared his **inmost** feelings with a girl and she rammed a _walking stick_ down his throat.

娠;with child;_Woman_ . . . _sign of the dragon_. The key word is a synonym for _pregnant_ , whose character we met earlier (Frame 546). Although the two kanji are often used together, they should be kept distinct.;1) [[adrianbarritt](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt)] 5-9-2007(254): Any _woman_ spending a night with the virile _Bruce Lee_ is bound to end up **with child**.;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 28-3-2008(54): BRUCE LEE'S WOMAN was **WITH CHILD** and it really upset her stomach because little Brandon Lee was kicking ass from the inside.
斤;ax;This character represents a picture of an **ax** , the two vertical lines being the handle and the horizontal strokes of the blade.

旭;rising sun;This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the **rising sun**. If you can picture two seams running down that great red _sun_ , and then imagine it sitting on a _baseball_ bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the **Rising Sun**.;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 11-11-2007(249): 9am carries with it the **rising sun**.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(137): _Nine planets_ revolve around our **rising sun**.
墾;groundbreaking;The **groundbreaking** referred to here is not for the erection of new buildings but for the opening of farmlands.

The Daily Bugle will love this! "Spider-pervert terrorizes city!".
舶;liner;The type of _boat_ connoted by this key word is a large oceangoing **liner**. The important thing here is to work with the elements _boat_ and _dove_ to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the _boat_ from the **liner**.;1) [[Transtic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic)] 28-4-2008(170): The most famous **LINER** is the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sunk. Just imagine that huge **LINER** strucking an even huger mass of **white** ice.;2) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 1-7-2006(92): A **liner** is to _boat_ as an [emperor](../v4/261.html) (#261 皇) is to a [king](../v4/255.html) (#255 王), or a [chief](../v4/967.html) (#967 伯) is to a [person](../v4/951.html) (#951 人): in each case we need only add _white_ to the latter in order to get the former.
帥;commander;Maestro . . . towel.;1) [[happychair](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair)] 6-3-2006(244): The **COMMANDER** is a military MAESTRO who never throws in the TOWEL.;2) [[tomtosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh)] 16-1-2008(43): I like to recall **commander** in conjuntion with _expert._ Both are _maestros_ with _towels_ – however, there is no upper limit (no _ceiling_ ) to what a **commander** can achieve in comparison to a mere expert.
渚;strand;The **strand** referred to here is the stretch of land along a beach or shoreline.

尿;urine;Flag . . . water.;1) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 5-1-2008(237): Animals use their **urine** to mark their territory. So for them, their body _water_ works as a _flag_ denoting their "country" ( _why bother? we all know which story you are going to pick_ ).;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 15-9-2006(128): Someone is pissing on the American flag, but since the **urine** is clear it looks like water.
賄;bribe;To the left we have the primitive for a _shellfish_ , and to the right the kanji we just learned for _possess_. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word _possess_ , and now expand your image of _shells_ to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is _possessed_ by _shells_ is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to **bribe** with a few extra _shells_.;1) [[Jiten](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jiten)] 16-3-2006(185): To **bribe** someone, money is a necessary possession.;2) [[martinirwin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinirwin)] 23-10-2007(162): If you possess enough shellfish, you can **bribe** anyone.
汎;pan-;The sense of the key word here is the "all-inclusive" we find in terms like " **Pan-** American Games." (It is also the character used in mathematics for "partial" as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a _water_ sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most _mediocre_ athletes, many of whom cannot even tread _water_. Now try to find a sponsor for the  " **Pan-** _Mediocre_ _Water_ Sports Competition. ";1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 23-1-2009(54): This is **pan** \- as in the prefix meaning "all". I think of **Pan** gea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now.;2) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 17-6-2007(22): Yeah, all our _water_ is fairly _mediocre_ , but if we work together in some **pan** -continental union, we can make some better _water_! As if.
栓;plug;Here we think of **plug** in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: _tree_ . . . _umbrella_ . . . _ball_. Imagine a _tree_ with a faucet in the side out of which tennis _balls_ are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach _umbrella_ into the _tree_ to **plug** it up.;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 12-10-2007(155): The fat _king_ under his _umbrella_ offers useless advice to the workers. "You'll need the _whole_ _tree_ to **plug** that gap". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they're doing.

This story reminds me how to build that part. ).;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 12-11-2007(92): To **plug** the hole, you need to use a _whole_ piece of _wood_ \- like a cork or something.
緻;fine;The key word should be taken to mean minute, detailed, or nuanced. Its primitive elements are: _thread_ . . . _doth_.;1) [[perrin4869](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869)] 23-9-2010(33): This kanji shows _Spiderman_ giving a dress of the **finest** thread to his girlfriend. Of course, the real purpose of the gift is to get his girlfriend to _doth_ him.;2) [[thecite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite)] 9-1-2010(16): **fine** : If the _thread_ _doth_ fit through the eye of the needle, it is **fine** _thread_ indeed.
硫;sulfur;Rock . . . infant . . . flood.;1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 4-11-2007(317): **Sulphur** is like a _rock_ , but it can stink like a _stream_ of _infant_ doodie.;2) [[PacifistGod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod)] 6-2-2007(69): Infants are baptised in streams inorder to prevent their descent into a place of **sulphur** and brimstone.

Only the brightest bugs graduate to become **lightning bugs**.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 15-2-2007(106): Q: Who's the smartest _insect_ in _school_? A: The **lightning-bug**. Because he's so bright! (Image: lightning bug in school with glasses, pocket protector, etc. Maybe even have some cool kids teasing him).
酉;sign of the bird;Though we shall later encounter the kanji for _bird_ , we introduce this one for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning.;1) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 15-7-2006(181): The **sign of the bird** on this whiskey bottle is of course the Famous Grouse blended Scotch.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 3-4-2007(124): Normally birds fly south, but _one_ bird flew _west_. People were worried about it and kept asking "Is there any **sign of the bird** – you know, the _one_ that flew _west_?".
丙;third class;Those no-frills flights the airlines offer to attract customers should help create an image from _ceiling_ . . . _person_ . . . _belt_. The kanji meaning " _inside_ " should not be used because of its proximity to the element for " _in_. ";1) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 15-9-2007(385): In this **third class** flight, the seat _belts_ are so bad that with the slightest turbulence all the _persons_ hit the ceiling. (it's almost pictographic here!).;2) [[somukeru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru)] 11-2-2008(26): Travelling by ship **third class** the cabins are all _inside_ (no windows) and the _ceilings_ are so low you hit your head.
醸;brew;Whiskey bottle . . . grass skirt.;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 2-9-2007(198): On the troical island of JOU, they **brew** _whiskey_ while wearing _grass skirts_ (top hats and scarves too). (Image: the strangely dresses islanders stirring a pot of **brew**.

Apparently you can **brew** whiskey out of grass skirts. No wonder it tastes horrible.
畝;furrow;Think of the three kinds of **furrows** shown here in this character - a _top hat's_ rim, a _rice field's_ ridges, and the wrinkles that show you've been around a _long time_.;1) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 19-3-2007(209): Using a TOP HAT to make **FURROW** S in the RICE FIELD takes a LONG TIME!;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 7-9-2007(107): A _mummy_ tries to **furrow** his brow but realizes that he's got no head - just a _brain_ with a _top-hat_ on it.

肪;obese;If you eat too much, you may need a _compass_ to find your way around the **obese** mass of _flesh_ that piles up in the midsection.

丼;donburi;_Donburi_ is a bowl of rice with eel or meat on it.
