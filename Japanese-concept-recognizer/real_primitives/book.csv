一;In Chinese characters, the number one is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right. [1];floor,ceiling;As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, since it is too abstract to be of much help. Instead, the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of _floor _or _ceiling, _depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means _ceiling; _if below, _floor._
七;As with four, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for five. [4];cut,diced;As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of _diced, _i.e., “cut” into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for _cut _切 to be learned in a later lesson (frame 89).
九;If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for power 力 (frame 922). [2];baseball team,nine,baseball;As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean _baseball team_ or simply _baseball. _The meaning, of course, is derived from the _nine _players who make up a team.
十;Turn this character 45º either way and you have the X used for the Roman numeral ten. [2];needle,ten;As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of _ten_ and sometimes signifies _needle, _this latter derived from the kanji for _needle _針 (frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.
口;Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for mouth is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle. [3];mouth;As a primitive, this form also means _mouth. _Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests--an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head--can be used for the primitive meaning.
日;This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun--like those yellow badges with the words, “Have a nice day!” [4];day,sun,tongue wagging in the mouth;Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean _sun _or _day _or a _tongue wagging in the mouth. _This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like “sayeth” and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (曰, frame 620).
月;This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical “man in the moon.” (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one month, of course, is one cycle of the moon. [4];moon flesh,part of the body;As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of _moon, flesh, _or_ part of the body. _The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.
田;Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird’s-eye view of a rice field divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4. [5];brains,rice field;When used as a primitive element, the meaning of _rice field _is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of _brains_ from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.
目;Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an eye. [5];eye,eyeball;As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of _eye, _or to be more specific, an _eyeball. _When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side like this: 罒.
古;The primitive elements that compose this character are ten and mouth, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with old inscriptions on the tombstones.;old;Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of _old, _but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.
早;This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the sun-flower, since it begins with the element for sun and is held up on a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine sunflowers with needles for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks.;sunflower,early;As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of _sun-flower, _which was used to make the abstract key word _early _more graphic.
丨;;one;This primitive element is a picture of just what it looks like: a cane or **walking stick**. It carries with it the connotations of lameness and whatever else one associates with the use of a cane. Rarely--but very rarely-- it will be laid on its side. Whenever this occurs, it will always be driven through the middle of some other primitive element. In this way, you need not worry about confusing it with the primitive meanings of _one. _[1]
;;;The meaning of this primitive is obvious from the first moment you look at it, though just what it will be **a drop of** will differ from case to case. The important thing is not to think of it as something insignificant like a “drop in the bucket” but as something so important that it can change the whole picture--like **a drop of** arsenic in your mother-in-law’s coffee. [1]
白;The color white is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single drop of sun spells white. [5];white,dove,bird;As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of _white_ or take the more graphic meaning of a _white_ _bird_ or _dove._ This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for _bird,_ which we shall get to later (frame 2091).
丸;We speak of “round numbers,” or “rounding a number off,” meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest drop, to nine, you end up with a round number. [3];fat man,round baseball player;As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a _fat man. _Think of a grotesquely _fat man_ whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a _round baseball player_ becomes a _fat man_.
寸;This kanji actually stood for a small measurement used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of measurement. In the old system, it was one-tenth of a shaku (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one drop of a ten (with a hook!). [3];glued to,glue;As a primitive, we shall use this to mean _glue_ or _glued to_. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard not to remember it.
博;At the left we have the needle; at the right, the kanji for specialty, plus an extra drop at the top. Think of a Dr. who is a specialist with a needle (an acupuncturist) and let the drop at the top represent the period at the end of Dr.;needle,acupuncturist;The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the _needle_ on the left and gets the meaning of an _acupuncturist_.
卜;;,a drop,walking stick;This is a picture of a **divining rod**_,_ composed of _a drop_ and a _walking stick_, but easy enough to remember as a pictograph. Alternately, you can think of it as a **magic wand**. In either case, it should suggest images of magic or fortune-telling.
;;sunflower,early,needle,needles;Here is our second example of a primitive composed of other primitives but not itself a kanji. At the bottom is the primitive (also a kanji) for _early _or _sunflower_. At the top, a _needle_. Conveniently, **mist** falls _early _in the morning, like little _needles_ of rain, to assure that the _sunflower_ blooms _early _as we have learned it should. [8]
;;eight;Like the four that follow it, this primitive is not a kanji in its own right, though it is said to be derived from 八, the character we learned earlier for _eight_. It always comes at the bottom of the primitive to which it is related. It can mean the **legs** of any kind of **animal**: from a grizzly bear’s paws to an octopus’s tentacles to the spindle shanks of a spider. (The one animal not allowed is our friend homo sapiens, whose legs figure in the next frame.) Even where the term “legs”** **will apply metaphorically to the legs of pieces of furniture, it is best to keep the association with **animal legs**. (You may review frame 6 here.) [2]
儿;;animal,legs;Notice how these **human legs** are somewhat shapelier and more highly evolved than those of the so-called “lower animals.” The one on the left, drawn first, is straight; while the one on the right bends gracefully and ends with a hook. Though they are not likely to suggest the **legs** of any **human **you know, they do have something of the look of someone out for a stroll, especially if you compare them to _animal_ _legs_.
几;;;This primitive gets its name from the full kanji for the **wind** (frame 563). It is called an “enclosure” because other elements are often drawn in the middle of it, though it can also be compressed together so that there is no room for anything in it. The main thing to remember when writing this element is that the second stroke bends outwards, like a gust of **wind **blown from above. In addition to the basic meaning of **wind**_, _we shall also have occasion to use the image of a **weather vane**. The derivation is obvious. [2]
勹;;wind;Like _wind, _the element meaning **bound up** is also an enclosure that can wrap itself around other elements or be compressed when there is nothing to enclose. When this latter happens--usually because there is not enough room-- and it is set on top, the little hook at the end is dropped off, like this: 聴.
;;one;This primitive element always appears at the top of the element to which it is related, and is always attached, or almost attached, to the first horizontal line to come under it. The **horns** can never simply be left hanging in the air. When there is no line available, an extra horizontal stroke (like a _one_) is added. The final kanji of this lesson gives an example.
貝;To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an eye and animal legs, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a shellfish with its ridged shell at the top and two little legs sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish shellfish with a single, gigantic eye roaming the beaches on its slender little legs, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers. [7];clam,shells,oyster;When used as a primitive, in addition to _shells, _the meanings _oyster_ and _clam_ will often come in handy.
頁;What we have to do here is turn a shellfish into a page of a book. The one at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact a book of only one page.;head;As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a _head_ (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for _head_ (frame 1549).
乙;The kanji shown here actually represents the “second” position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are “pure,” “tasteful,” “quaint,” and--get this! --fish guts. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word. [1];fishhook,hook;We will take _fishhook_ and _hook_ as primitive meanings. The shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape: 肌. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics: 乚. Examples follow.
;;animal,legs;Although this primitive is not very common, it is useful to know, as the following examples will show. Conveniently, it is always drawn at the very bottom of any kanji in which it figures. The first stroke, the horizontal one, is detached from anything above it, but is necessary to distinguish **tool **from _animal_ _legs_. The sense of the element is a carpenter’s **tool**, which comes from its pictographic representation of a small table with legs (make them _animal_ _legs_ if you need a more graphic image), so that any element lying on top of it will come to be viewed as a **tool **in the hands of a carpenter. [3]
;;ten;This primitive has the look of _ten_, except that the left stroke is bent down toward the left. It indicates where your hands (your _ten_ fingers) fall when you let them droop: **by your side**.
工;The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind that is used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for craft in general. [3];craft,i beam,artificial;As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of _craft _and also takes on the related meanings of _I beam_ and _artificial_.
刀;Although this kanji no longer looks very much like a sword, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the sword. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji. [2];dagger,saber;In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a _dagger_. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out like this 刂 and takes the sense of a great and flashing _saber_, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (frame 1801).
召;A sword or dagger posed over a mouth is how the character for “beckoning” is written. The related but less tame key word seduce was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the--how shall we put it?--Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is seducing the small round one or vice versa.) [5];seduce;The primitive meaning remains the same: _seduce_. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.
;;fields,mouth,one;To prepare for following frame, we introduce here a somewhat rare primitive meaning **wealth**. It takes its meaning from the common image of the over**wealthy **as also being overfed. More specifically, the kanji shows us _one_ single _mouth_ devouring all the harvest of the _fields_, presumably while those who labor in them go hungry. Think of the phrase exactly as it is written when you draw the character, and the disposition of the elements is easy. [9]
丁;The picture here is of a street sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any street that immediately conjures up the image of a street sign to you. [2];street,spike,nail;Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a _nail_ or a _spike_. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a _street_ sign out of the ground and using it as a _nail_ to repair your garage roof.
子;This kanji is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young children who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother’s neck. [3];child;As a primitive, the meaning of _child _is retained, though you might imagine a little older _child,_ able to run around and get into more mischief.
女;You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting woman drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing. [3];woman;The primitive meaning is the same: _woman_.
母;Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for woman in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a mama. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother’s breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language- groups. [5];breasts;As a primitive we shall add the meaning of _breasts_ in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.
兄;By now kanji like this one should “look like” something to you even though it is more of an “ideogram” than a “pictograph.” The large mouth on top and the human legs below almost jump off the page as a caricature of elder brother, the one with the big mouth (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who “has the say” among all the children). [5];teenager,mouth,legs;As a primitive this character will take the meaning of _teenager_, in accord with the familiar image of the big _mouth_ and the gangling, clumsy _legs_.
小;The sense of little in this character is not the same as “a little bit.” That meaning comes in the next frame. Here little means “small” or “tiny.” The image is one of three little drops, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: little, little, nothing but little. [3];;The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards like this: _._
大;Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of large. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms. [3];bernard,st,large,dog;As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a _large_ _dog_ or, if you prefer, a _St._ _Bernard_ _dog_. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.
夕;Just as the word evening adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word “night,” so the kanji for evening takes the ordinary looking moon in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame). [3];;The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.
厂;;;This primitive means precisely what it looks like: a steep **cliff**. You can almost see someone standing at the top looking down into the abyss below. [2]
石;With a mouth under a cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care--the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. [5];rocks,stones,stone;The _stone_ is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of _stones_ or _rocks _of any size or shape.
肖;The word resemblance should suggest, among other things, a son’s resemblance to his father. A “chip off the old block” is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a little bit of flesh. [7];fire,candle,resemblance,moon,spark;When used as a primitive, the sense of _resemblance_ is replaced by that of _spark_ or _candle_. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for _moon_ also carries a secondary sense of _fire_, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)
川;We have taken the image of a river stream over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a stream. [3];flood,stream;As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of _stream_ the more vivid image of a _flood_. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements:
水;This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water--not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. [4];;As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive, like this: 氵_._ This latter, as we will see, is far more common.
泉;Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of water, and you will probably notice how the top of the spring you are thinking of, the part where the “bubbling” goes on, is all white. Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and the water is at the bottom. [9];spring,little,water,drops;We will keep this image of a _spring_ when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for _water_) are abbreviated to the three small _drops_ that we learned earlier as the kanji for _little, _giving us: .
土;I don’t like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try. [3];ground,dirt,soil,land;As a primitive, the sense of _soil_ is extended to that of _ground_ because of its connection with the kanji for the same (frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of _dirt_ and _land_.
圭;Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is.;ivy,ground;As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean _ivy_, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the _ground_ to form a sort of “second” _ground_ that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.
火;Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form--first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there--to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes. [4];fireplace,fire,hearth,flames cauldron cooking,oven fire,conflagration;To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a _fireplace_ (or _hearth_) or a raging _conflagration_ like a forest fire for this kanji’s primitive meaning. Another primitive element for _fire,_ based on this one, is written 灬 and will mean _flames, cauldron, cooking_ _fire, _or an _oven fire_.
里;That’s right--a ri. Don’t bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it’s a Japanese word for measuring distances. One ri is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a “country mile.” The land division based on the size of a rice field is called a ri. [7];computer,logic;To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a _computer_, a meaning deriving from the kanji for _logic,_ which we will meet in Lesson 12.
冂;;wind;In addition to the basic meaning of **hood**, this shape can be used for a **glass canopy**, such as that used to serve “pheasant under glass.” Note its difference from the element for _wind_: the second stroke is hooked inwards here. To help remember this detail, think of the wind as blowing “out” and a **glass canopy **as keeping something “in.” Among the related images suggested by this primitive are: a monk’s** cowl**, a riding **hood**, a **helmet**, and an automobile **hood**. [2]
同;The primitives given are one and mouth under a hood. Take the key word to connote the sameness that characterizes the life in a community of monks. They all have the same habits, including the “habit” they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk’s cowl, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a mouth. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of one mouth under a hood as the kanji for the sameness of monastic life. [6];monks;As a primitive, this kanji will mean _monks _dressed in a common habit.
宀;;;This extremely useful primitive element depicts the roof of a **house**. You can see the chimney at the top and the eaves on either side without much trouble. It is a “crown” element, which means that it is invariably set atop other things. Examples follow immediately. [3]
木;Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. [4];wood,pole,tree,wooden;As a primitive, this kanji can mean _tree_ or _wood_. When the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (), we shall change its meaning to _pole_, or _wooden_ _pole._
艹;;;We are not yet equipped with all the pieces necessary to learn the character for **flower**, so shall have to content ourselves here with the first three strokes, which represent the primitive of the same meaning. Concentrate on the actual “bloom” of the **flower**, and keep a particular flower in mind. Try a rose, a tulip, or a daisy, since none of them will have their own kanji. Think about it well, since once you have decided on your **flower** of choice, you will be using it in a rather large number of stories later on. [3]
莫;;flowers,st bernard,sun;The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern **graveyard**. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored _flowers_ placed before the tombstones, the _sun_ shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly _St. Bernard _sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10]
兆;Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that portend coming evils. [6];turtle,portent;When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key- word sense of a _portent._ When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only, ⺦), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a _turtle._
犬;We know that the kanji for large takes on the meaning of the St. Bernard dog when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The drop added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized dog, which, compared to the St. Bernard, is no more than a drop in the kennel. [4];a pack of wild dogs,chihuahua;As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a _chihuahua _for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of _a pack of wild dogs._
牛;Can you see the “doodle” of a cow that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs. [4];cow;As a primitive, the same sense of _cow_ is kept. Note only that when it is placed over another element, its tail is cut off, giving us . In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.
;;one umbrella;This compound primitive depicts a **meeting** as a massive gathering of people under _one umbrella._ The full kanji from which this derives will be introduced later in frame 814. The important thing here is to picture the scene just described and associate it with the word **meeting**. [3]
王;See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a king’s scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for I beam and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in. [4];king,scepter,ball;As a primitive, this can mean either _king_ or _scepter, _but it will usually be taken to mean _ball, _as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.
玉;Note the drop here in the king’s scepter, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious jewel handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power. [5];jewel,ball;As a primitive, we can use this to mean either _jewel_ or _ball. _When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it generally takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame, .
主;“A man’s home is his castle,” goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was lord of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or drop) of a king in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to “read off” the primitives in this way, you won’t end up putting the drop down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel. [5];candlestick;As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass _candlestick _(with the drop representing the flame at the top).
金;If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars. [8];gold,metal;As a primitive, it means not only _gold_ but any _metal _at all.
⻌;;;The **road** envisioned here is a road for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3]
車;You may keep the whole range of connotations for this key word, car, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them. [7];cart,car,wagon,vehicle;_Car_, _cart_, _wagon_, and _vehicle _may all be used as primitive meanings.
⼡;;;We call this element **walking legs **because it indicates “legs in motion,” whether you want to think of them as jogging or walking in long strides, as the shape seems to suggest. Be careful how you write it, with the first two strokes like a stylized “7.” [3]
各;“Suum cuique” goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her mouth between his/her walking legs, giving us an image of “To each his/her own.” [6];;The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word “every,” which we shall meet later in another context.
⼍;;drop,roof;This pictograph of a simple **crown** is distinguished from the _roof_ only by the absence of the chimney (the first _drop_ at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word **crown**. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in frame 326. [2]
軍;The crowned vehicle depicted here is a “chariot,” symbol of an army. [9];chariot;Used as a primitive this kanji means only _chariot_.
亠;;;The broad rim and tall top of the **top hat** is pictured graphically here in these two simple strokes.
;;weather vane,top hat,wind;A formal high silk _top hat_ resting atop a _weather vane _represents a **whirlwind**. To keep it distinct from the primitive for _wind_, try to picture the vortex, or tornado-like spinning movement, of a **whirlwind**. The next frame should help. [4]
高;Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the mouth under the extraterrestrial’s glass hood, and then the mouth under the top hat of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling’s headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much taller than everyone else. [10];tall;As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of _tall_ and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes: .
;;soil,mouth;_Soil_ over the _mouth_ of a container gives us a piece of clay pottery with its lid. Behold the **lidded crock**. [6]
周;Look more closely at your lidded crock and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the circumference of your motorcycle helmet: just begin at a fixed point and turn the lidded crock around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the helmet, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your lidded crock made, you now know the circumference. [8];lap;As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a _lap_.
士;The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for soil by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan’s gentlemen. [3];samurai;The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the _samurai_, Japan’s warrior class.
吉;Here we see a samurai standing on a street with an open mouth, which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for good luck. [6];lidded,mouth,crock,can,lid,aerosol;As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an _aerosol_ _can_, from the _mouth_ and the very tightly-fitting _lid_ (note how it differs here from the _lidded_ _crock_).
;;;Here we see a little red **schoolhouse** with the 3 dots on the roof. As you write it in the following frames, you should acquire a “feel” for the way the first two short strokes move left to right, and the third one right to left. Write it twice now, saying to yourself the first time as you write the first 3 strokes, “In the **schoolhouse **we learn our A-B-Cs,” and the second time, “In the **schoolhouse **we learn our 1-2-3s.” [5]
聿;;,cow;This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing **brush**. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the **brush**, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of _cow_, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its “tail” is cut off, giving us _._ [6]
攵;;walking,woman,legs;First find the long rod (the first stroke), held in the hand of someone seated (the next 3 strokes, not unlike the pictograph for _woman_, but quite different from that for _walking_ _legs_ introduced in Lesson 13). The only thing left to do is conjure up the memory of some **taskmaster** (or taskmistress) from your past whom you will “never forget.” [4]
言;Of all the things we can do with our mouth, speech requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for say has four little sound-waves, to show the complexity of the task. [7];speech,saying,words;This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean _saying_, _speech_, or _words_, depending on which is most useful.
弋;;;Here we see a pictograph of a long and slightly warped **arrow**. By extending the short final stroke in both directions, you should see the **arrow**head without any difficulty. The hook at the bottom represents the feathers at the butt end. When it serves as a semi-enclosure for other primitives, the first stroke is drawn longer, as we shall see in the following frames. [3]
;;arrows,one;This primitive is easy to remember as depicting something used to bring all one’s _arrows_ together into _one_ handy place: the **quiver**. [4]
戈;;arrow;The picture in this primitive is what we may call a “tassled _arrow_.” A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an _arrow_ to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a **fiesta**. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semi-enclosure. [4]
;;fiesta,land;I choose the word **Thanksgiving **as only one possible way of making this primitive more concrete. The sense, as its composite primitives make clear, is of a “_land_ _fiesta_,” or a harvest feast. If you choose a word of your own, make sure it does not conflict with _fiesta_. [6]
戊;;fiesta;Note first the order of the writing. The first stroke, added to _fiesta,_ gives us a full-fledged enclosure, because of which we should always think of this as a **parade of **something or other, namely whatever is inside the enclosure. [5]
戌;;parade,one;As distinct from the _parade_, the **march **points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the _parade_. The inclusion of the _one_ gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the **march**. As was the case with _parade, _the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is **marching**. [6]
;;fiesta;The **floats **that are such an important part of a _fiesta_ are shown here by the addition of the two extra horizontal strokes, which you may take as a quasi-pictographic representation of the platform structure of a **float**. [6]
止;The character for stop is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot. [4];stop,footprint;Although the meaning of _stop_ will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of _footprint_.
;;correct;This primitive differs from the kanji for _correct_ only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the “-ing” of **mending **if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like **mending** holes in socks. [5]
廴;;road;The primitive meaning to **stretch** might at first seem similar to that for _road_. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like _road_, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3]
疋;;mending;To avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up, this primitive will signify a **zoo**. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from _mending._ Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]
衣;At the top we see the top hat, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a garment. If you break the “4-fold” fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember. [6];scarf,cloak;Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of _cloak _or _scarf_ will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here.
;;crowns,towel;The _towel _that has edges jagged like little _crowns_ is the cook’s **apron**. [5]
⼌;;towel;This primitive, clearly derived from that for _towel_, is always hung on another vertical stroke, and takes the meaning of a **belt**. [2]
云;;;This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a **cloud **of something **rising **upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4]
雨;This kanji, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the rain collected there and waiting to fall. [8];weather,,rain,crown;As a primitive it can mean either _rain_ or _weather_ in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a _crown_ like this: _._
冫;;,water;The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean _water_ into two drops signals the solidifying of _water_ into **ice**. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for _water_, 冫, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the _water_ primitive: _._ [2]
天;This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the Heavens. (You may, of course, use the elements ceiling and St. Bernard instead.) [4];,witch,heaven,thousand,heavens;The primitive can mean either the _heaven_ of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the _heavens_. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of _thousand_ (frame 40), rather than left to right, giving us: 夭_. _From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a _witch._
喬;;witch,top hat,tall;The sense of the primitive, **angel**, derives from the primitive for _witch_ replacing the _top hat_ in the character for _tall_. [12]
立;This picture of a vase standing up has its meaning extended to represent the general posture of anything standing up. [5];;Used as a primitive, it can also mean vase. Using its kanji meaning, think of something standing up that is normally lying down, or something standing up in an unusual way.
;;vase,old,hood,glass;The primitive meaning **antique**, not itself a kanji, depicts a _vase_ kept under a _glass_ _hood_ because it is very, very _old_. [11]
匕;This character, a pictograph of a spoon, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for seven, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second. [2];;As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone sitting on the ground, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first--or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.
;;the,on,siesta,bound up,ground,sitting,sun;Conjure up the classic portrait of the Latin _siesta_: a muchacho _sitting_ _on_ _the_ _ground_, propped up against some building, _bound up_ from neck to ankles in a serape, one of those great, broad-rimmed mariachi hats pulled down over his face, and the noonday _sun_ beating down overhead. Always use the complete image, never simply the general sense of **siesta**. [8]
;;lying,down;The picture is obvious: the first stroke represents the head, and the second the body of someone **reclining**. You may also use the synonyms _lying_ or _lying_ _down_. [2]
;;walking,lie,legs,down,days;Either the idea of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or of folding an object in half will do. The kanji depicts someone **doubling back **to the nearest inn to _lie_ _down_ and rest a weary pair of _walking_ _legs_ after a full _day’s_ voyage. [9]
欠;The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a lack of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see. [4];;When used as a primitive element, this kanji can mean either yawn or lack.
次;Earlier we made mention of the story of Briar Rose (or “Sleeping Beauty,” as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the briar hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the second part of the story, these briars blossomed into flowers. Hence her name, Briar Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for thorn (frame 446). [9];;As a primitive, this character can either retain its key word meaning of next or the related meaning of second.
;;vase,mouth;The element for **muzzle **shows a _vase_ fixed over a _mouth_, perhaps with a rubber band running around the back of the head to keep it in place. [8]
音;The kanji for sound depicts something standing in the air over a tongue wagging in a mouth, much the same as a sound does for the briefest of moments before disappearing. [9];;The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.
;;fiesta,sound;This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanji. It pictures the _sound_ of a _fiesta_, namely a **kazoo**. Note how the element for _sound _is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for _fiesta_. [12]
竟;;human,mouth,tonguewagging,legs,standing;This primitive gets its meaning from the following frame. It shows a pair of _human_ _legs_ and a _tongue-wagging_ _mouth_ looking at a **mirror** _standing_ on the wall, asking perhaps who might be the fairest of them all. [11]
亡;A top hat hanging on a hook in the front hall, right where the deceased left it the day he died, reminds us of him and his kanji. [3];;In addition to deceased, the primitive meaning of to perish will also be used for this character.
方;;;As a primitive, this character will take the sense of a compass, the instrument used to determine direction.
;;teenager,horns;The two _horns_ on the head of the _teenager_ are enough to suggest to most parents of adolescents a good image of a **devil**. [7]
曽;This primitive (named for its associations with the kanji of the following frame) is composed of a pair of horns growing out of a brain with a tongue wagging in the mouth beneath. Think of “former” in connection with administrators or heads of state who have just left office but continue to make a nuisance of themselves by advertising their opinions on public policy. [11];;The primitive meaning, increase, comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch.
東;As a “Western” language, English identifies the east with the rising sun. In more fanciful terms, we see the sun piercing through a tree as it rises in the east. [8];;Both the direction east and the part of the world called “the East” are primitive meanings of this character.
壬;;samurai;Let the extended dot at the top represent the load that the _samurai_ is carrying in his role as the master’s **porter**. [4]
也;;fishhook;This primitive is a pictograph of the **scorpion**, the first 2 strokes representing its head and pincers, the last stroke its barbed tail, in which you may recognize the _fishhook_. [3]
虫;Work with the pictograph as you wish. [6];insect;As a primitive, this insect will refer to the whole _insect_ kingdom;, it can be specified for each kanji that contains it.
己;The kanji carries the abstract sense of the self, the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a snake-- which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar key words, oneself (frame 36) and I (frame 17). [3];snake;As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the _snake_--of which it is a pictograph--or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the _snake_ has in myth and fable.
包;Bind up . . . snake. [5];snake,wrap;The primitive meaning of _wrap_ should always be used with the _snake_ in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let “_wrap_” mean “with a snake coiled about it.”
亀;This is not a turtle (see frame 250) but a tortoise, however you wish to picture the difference. Let the “bound up” at the top refer to the head, and the two suns, with a long tail running through it, to the shell. [11];eel,bucket of eels;When this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half (),  it takes the primitive meaning of an _eel_. When only the first two strokes are omitted (), it will mean a _bucket of eels. _Examples of this latter will not appear until Vol. 3.
豕;;;Let this primitive represent a fat **sow**. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six frames. [7]
;;sow;This abbreviation of the full primitive for a _sow_, quite naturally, means **piglets**. [5]
昜;;piglet,day;This very helpful primitive element is worth the few moments it takes to learn it. Just remember that each _day_ you put a few pennies into the back of the little _piglet_ on your bureau that you call a **piggy bank**. [9]
羊;This pictograph shows the animal horns at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke). [6];cow,sheep;The primitive meaning of _sheep_ can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the _cow_, the “tail” is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: . Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame.
;;sheep;This rather uncommon primitive is made by pulling the tail of the _sheep_ to one side to create a semi-enclosure. The meaning of **wool** is derived from the fact that the shearer is holding the _sheep_ by the tail in order to trim its **wool**. [7]
隹;;turkeys;This primitive is best remembered as an old **turkey**, complete with pipe and monocle. Its writing is somewhat peculiar, so take note of the order of the strokes. Let the first four strokes stand for the _turkey’s_ head, neck, and drooping chin. The remainder can then be pictographic of the plumage. [8]
午;With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse’s head pointing leftward in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of noon. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for cow (frame 260). [4];horses,horse,of,team;As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a _horse_. Any _horse_ image will do, except that of a _team_ _of_ _horses_, which will come later (frame 2132) and get its own primitive.
;;flying,horse,turkey,turkey house;By combining the _horse_ (giving a twist to its final stroke a bit to the left to keep the strokes from overlapping) with the _turkey_, we get a _flying_ _horse_ or **Pegasus**. Be sure not to confuse with the rarer element for _turkey house_ that was introduced in frame 609. [11]
羽;From the pictograph of two bird-wings, we get feathers. [6];wings;The related image of _wings_ can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form  when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619.
囗;;;This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus **pent in**. [3]
广;;cliff,house;This primitive combines the _cliff_ (the last 2 strokes) with the first dot we use on the roof of the _house_. Together they make a “cliff house” or **cave**. It “encloses” its relative primitives beneath it and to the right. [3]
心;This character, a pictographic representation of the heart, is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet. [4];;As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings.
手;Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a hand in this character. But that it is, and so you must. [4];hand;Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single _hand_ all by itself.
⺘;;hand,finger,fingers;This alternate form of the primitive for _hand_ we shall use to represent _finger_ or _fingers_. It always appears at the left. [3]
;;;Let this primitive represent a union of **two hands**, both of which are used at the same time. Whenever this element appears at the bottom of its relative primitive, the top line is omitted, whether or not there is a horizontal line to replace it. [4]
才;Whatever one is particularly adept at--one’s special “genius”--one can do very easily, “with one finger” as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for fingers backwards. [3];the,genie,genius,bottle,in;The primitive meaning, _genie_, derives from the roots of the word _genius_. Use the _genie_ out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered to , and the meaning becomes a _genie_ _in_ _the_ _bottle._
乃;This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the “hand-primitives.” Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a fist (the primitive meaning) “from” this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word. [2];fist;The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a _fist_.
及;The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched fist into the kanji for reaching out, much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance. [3];hands,beg,outstretched;As a primitive, this shall stand for _outstretched_ _hands_. Only take care not to confuse it with that for _beg_ (frame 501)
;;;The picture of an **arm** dangling from the trunk of the body gives us the element for **arm**, or **tucked under the arm** (relative to the element below it). Examples of both usages follow. Unlike most primitives, the kanji that bears the same meaning (frame 1522) has absolutely no connection with it. [2]
又;Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate “and” (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of or again. [2];crotch;As a primitive, it will mean _crotch_, as in the _crotch_ of the arm. Or whatever.
殳;;wind    crotch;Although modern connotations are more suggestive, this primitive simply refers to something thrown as a weapon. Its elements: _wind . . . crotch_. [4]
圣;;earth,crotch;Here we see a simplified drawing of a **spool** (the element for _earth_ at the bottom) with threads being wound about it tightly (the _crotch_ at the top). You may remember it either pictographically or by way of the primitives. [5]
爪;This character is a pictograph of a bird’s claw, and from there comes to mean animal claws in general (including human fingernails). [4];,vulture,claws;As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a _vulture_, a bird known for its powerful _claws_. It generally appears above another primitive, in which case it gets squeezed into the form 爫_._
脆;;vulture,child;The _vulture_ and _child_ combine to create the image of an aerie full of **fledglings**. [7]
脇;;house,claw;The _claw_ and crown of the roof of a _house_ (whose chimney is displaced by the _claw_) combine to give us a **birdhouse**. [6]
厶;;;This pictograph of an arm bent at the **elbow** is obvious. [2]
脈;;elbow,ceiling;The _elbow_ hanging under a _ceiling_ will become our element for a **wall**. [3]
脳;;child;This primitive can be seen as an abbreviation of the full primitive for _child_, the second stroke dividing the head from the body much as it does in 子 and the other strokes condensing the long form so that it can be used atop its relative primitive. We change the meaning to **infant** to facilitate keeping the full form and its abbreviation distinct. [4]
入;This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftward, putting one leg forward in order to enter someplace. Since the “in” side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character. [2];come,to,eight,put,umbrella,go,in;As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: _to_ _go_ _in,_ _to_ _put_ _in,_ _to_ _come_ _in,_ and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for _umbrella_ , the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for _eight._ When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.
脹;;,valley;As_ _an_ _abbreviation_ _of_ _the_ _kanji_ _for_ _a_ valley_,_ _this_ _primitive_ _gets_ _its meaning_ _as_ _a_ _small_ _valley_ _or_ _**gully**._ _[5]
脾;;,birdhouse,little,mouth;The_ _combination_ _of_ _the_ _element_ _for_ little_,_ _the_ _basic_ “_roof” structure here (in_ _which_ _the_ _chimney_ _was_ _overwritten,_ _as it was in_ _the_ _element_ _for_ birdhouse_), combined with the_ _“window”_ _(_mouth_)_ _below,_ _gives_ _this_ _element_ _its_ _meaning_ _of_ _**outhouse**._ _Although_ _the_ _window_ _is_ _not_ _an_ _essential_ _part_ _of_ _an_ _**outhouse**,_ _I_ _think_ _you_ _will_ _agree_ _that_ _its_ _inclusion_ _is_ _a_ _boon_ _to the imagination, greatly_ _simplifying the_ _learning of_ _the_ _characters_ _in_ _which_ _it_ _appears._ _[8]
歹;;,evening;This_ _character_ _is_ _meant_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _pictograph_ _of_ _a_ _**bone**_ _attached_ _to_ _a_ _piece of_ _flesh_ _(or_ _vice versa.)_ _The_ _first_ _stroke_ _serves_ _to_ _keep_ _it_ _distinct_ _from the_ _character_ _for_ evening _(frame_ _114)._ _[4]
舛;;,measuring box,evening;These_ _two_ _elements_ _are_ _actually_ _the full form whose abbreviation we learned as the character_ _for_ measuring box _in_ _frame_ _42._ _To_ _the_ _left,_ _we_ _see_ _the familiar_ _shape_ _of_ evening_,_ _and_ _to_ _the_ _right_ _a_ _completely_ _new_ _shape._ _The meaning_ _we_ _have_ _assigned,_ _**sunglasses**,_ _is_ _entirely_ _arbitrary._ _[7]
曼;;,sun    eye    crotch;_Sun . . . eye . . . crotch_._ _[11]
臣;This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The “pop-eye” image belongs to an Emperor’s retainer standing in awe before his ruler. [7];,slave;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _the_ _meaning_ _of_ _the_ _key word_ _becomes_ slave_.
力;With a little imagination, one can see a muscle in this simple, two-stroke character meaning power. [2];,power,muscle;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _either_ muscle _or_ power _can_ _be_ _used.
行;By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for going. [6];,boulevard,line,column going;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _this_ _character_ _has_ _two_ _forms._ _Reduced_ _to_ _the_ _left_ _side only,_ _彳,_ _it_ _can_ _mean_ _a_ column, going_,_ _or_ _a_ line_ of something or other._ _When_ _the_ _middle is_ _opened_ _up_ _to make room for_ _other_ _elements,_ _it_ _means_ _a_ boulevard_.
禾;;,tree;This_ _primitive_ _element will be_ _made_ _to_ _stand_ _for_ _**wheat**_. _It_ _connotes_ _a_ _special_ _grain,_ _more_ _expensive_ _than_ _ordinary_ _rice_ _and so_ _reserved_ _for_ _special_ _occasions._ _Alternatively,_ _it_ _can_ _mean_ _cereal. Its_ _form_ _is_ _like_ _that_ _for_ tree_,_ _except_ _for_ _the_ _dot_ _at_ _the_ _top_ _to represent_ _a_ _spike_ _of_ _**wheat**_ _blowing_ _in_ _the_ _wind._ _[5]
米;This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of rice lying on a plate in the shape of a star. [6];,br classcalibre ,wheat,rice;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _it_ _keeps_ _its_ _meaning_ _of_ rice_,_ _and_ _is_ _meant_ _to_ _connote a_ _very_ _ordinary,_ _commonplace_ _grain,_ _in_ _contrast_ _to_ _the_ _primitive_ _for_ wheat _that_ _we_ _just_ _learned._ _(This_ _meaning_ _accords_ _well_ _with_ _Japan, where_ _the_ _output_ _of_ rice _far_ _exceeds_ _that_ _of_ wheat_.)_   _
竹;Bamboo grows upwards, like a straight nail, and at each stage of its growth (which legend associates with the arrival of the new moon) there is a jointed rootstock (the first stroke). Two such bamboo stalks are pictured here. [6];,flowers;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _the_ _meaning_ _remains_ _the_ _same,_ _but_ _the_ _vertical_ _lines_ _are severely_ _abbreviated_ _so_ _that_ _they_ _can_ _take_ _their_ _place_ _at_ _the_ _top_ _where, like_ flowers_,_ _they_ _are_ _always_ _to_ _be_ _found.
人;The character for enter (frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing). The one for person, shown here, represents someone walking outwards. [2];;As_ _a_ _primitive,_ _it_ _can_ _keep_ _its_ _kanji_ _form_ _except_ _when_ _it_ _appears_ _to_ _the left_ _(its_ _normal_ _position),_ _where_ _it_ _is_ _made_ _to_ _stand_ _up_ _in_ _the_ _form 亻_._
从;;,person;The_ _duplication_ _of_ _the_ _kanji_ _for_ person _gives_ _us_ _this_ _primitive_ _for **assembly line**._ _Perhaps_ _you_ _can_ _imagine_ _clones_ _of_ _your_ _chosen _person _rolling off_ _an_ _assembly_ _line_ _in_ _a_ _factory._ _[4]
;;;Take_ _this_ _as_ _a_ _pictograph_ _of_ _a_ _**plow**._ _[2]
并;;,horns    two hands;Think_ _of_ _this_ _element_ _as_ _a_ _picture_ _**puzzle**_ _in_ _which_ _the_ _pieces_ _interlock. Its_ _elements:_ horns . . . two hands_._ _[6]
;;,rice,little    belt    little,belt,taskmaster;The_ _element_ _on_ _the_ _left_ _looks_ _like_ rice _with_ _a_ belt _running_ _through it,_ _but_ _we_ _would_ _do_ _best_ _to_ _think_ _of_ _it_ _in_ _terms_ _of_ _its_ _writing_ _order:_ little . . . belt . . . little_._ _On_ _the_ _right,_ _of_ _course,_ _the_ taskmaster_. [12]
;;,compass,reclining;Here_ _we_ _have_ _a_ _unique_ _enclosure_ _made_ _up_ _of_ _two_ _elements:_ compass _and_ reclining_._ _Think_ _of_ _the_ _**banner**_ _as_ _a_ _standard_ _for_ _rallying_ _around; then_ _imagine_ _a_ _crowd_ reclining _before_ _a_ compass _(presumably to_ _give_ _them_ _a “direction”_ _in_ _life)._ _[6]
尸;;;The_ _pictographic_ _representation_ _of_ _this_ _element_ _is_ _obvious._ _Provided_ _you_ _can hold_ _your_ _imagination_ _in_ _check_ _for_ _the_ _first_ _example,_ _you_ _might_ _best_ _imagine your_ _own_ _national_ _**flag**_ _in_ _composing_ _your_ _stories._ _[3]
示;Although the elements two and little are available for the using, it may be easier to remember this character as a picture of an altar. Something placed atop the altar is put on show for all to see. [5];altar,cloak;As a primitive, this kanji means _altar_. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the _altar_ in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, 礻, should be kept distinct from that for _cloak_, 衤, identical except for the one final short stroke.
由;The “wherefore” of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a rice field sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and wherefore of the seed’s falling in the earth and dying. (When the flower appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full seedling.) [5];sprout;As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean a _sprout_.
甲;This kanji reverses the element for sprout, giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the rice field. From there you must invent a connection to the key word, armor. [5];roots;The primitive meaning is _roots_. Important to that word is the image of “pushing downwards,” as _roots_ do.
申;The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb “to speak.” It is written by a tongue wagging in the mouth with a walking stick rammed through it and coming out at both ends. [5];speaketh,monkey;While this kanji has obvious affinities to the “seed” group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the _monkey_ (the one who _speaketh_ no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take _monkey_ as its primitive meaning.
乍;;ax;The **saw **in this primitive is distinguished from the primitive for _ax_ by the extra “teeth” on the blade. [5]
;;;The pictographic representation here is of the bristles on the head of a **broom**. Note that the second stroke stops short without cutting through the second. [3]
;;broom,cow,sheep;A single vertical stroke transforms _broom_ into a **rake**. When an element comes below the **rake**, the vertical stroke is shortened, as we have seen before with other similar primitives such as _sheep_ and _cow_. Moreover, when something comes above the **rake **and joins to it at the top, the vertical stroke begins at the top horizontal stroke, as in the following two frames. [4]
;;rice,of,rake,grains;A _rake_ and the _grains_ _of_ _rice_ at the bottom give us a hint of winnowing, which relates clearly to the meaning of a **sieve**. [8]
尹;;rake;The only thing distinguishing a **mop** from a _rake_ is the bent handle that does not cut through the top horizontal stroke. It depicts the swish-swash motion of a **mop**. [4]
而;;;The pictograph of a **comb** is clearly visible in this primitive element. [6]
凵;;;This enclosure--which embraces its relative primitive from the bottom--is a pictograph of the scoop of a **shovel**. When room permits, the arms are extended upwards to nearly the same height as the relative element it holds. [2]
斗;The Big Dipper here is of course the constellation of Ursa Major, of which this kanji is a sort of pictographic representation. [4];cup,measuring,ladle;Since we already have a primitive element for a “dipper”--namely, the _ladle_ --we shall let this one stand for a _measuring_ _cup_. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!
用;Flesh . . . walking stick. Be sure to keep this key word distinct from that for use (frame 1065). The stroke order is exactly as you would expect it from the order of the primitive elements as given. [5];screwdriver,utilized;As a primitive element, we shall substitute the image of a _screwdriver_, perhaps the most _utilized_ of all tools around the house.
;;flowers;The element for _flowers _joins with the long horizontal stroke beneath it to create the picture of a bowl of **salad**. [4]
;;twenty,caves,cave;The primitive for **caverns **differs from that for _cave_ by the presence of the primitive for _twenty, _suggesting a maze of underground _caves. _[7]
卉;;two handsmdash,needles;The three _needles _stacked up give us a **haystack** (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the _needles_). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following frame, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as _two hands--_that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]
尭;;human legs,haystack;The two _human legs _added to the _haystack_ (with the horizontal stroke to keep the two parts distinct from one another and avoid an ugly tangle) give us a **straw man**. [8]
;;half;This character simply splits the vertical stroke of a _half _in half once again, to get a **quarter**. In so doing, it spreads the split stroke out to form a sort of enclosure under which its main relative primitive will be placed. It can be used either in its substantive or verbal meaning. [6]
之;This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it. [3];building blocks;In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to _building blocks _with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child.
;;saber;This weapon, which has the appearance of the long _saber_ but is drawn slightly differently, depicts a **spear**. It appears very rarely--in fact, only twice and both instances are given in the following frames. [2]
弗;;walking sticks,bow;Composed of two _walking sticks _running through a _bow, _this character is infrequent as a primitive, and yet easy to remember for what it looks like (which is also what the Japanese adopted it to mean in days gone by): the **dollar **sign, $. When it is written under another element, the first vertical stroke is abbreviated to a short “tail” as the final stroke, and the second vertical stroke is cut off at the top. Examples follow in frames 1327 and 1328. [5]
;;bow;The simple **snare** composed of a piece of vine and a bent twig is depicted here as a sort of abbreviation of the _bow, _to which it is related. [2]
;;snare;The **slingshot** differs from the _snare_ by virtue of the first stroke, which you may take as the strip of rubber you pull back on, to make the **slingshot **sling. [2]
老;First, do not confuse this character with venerable old man (frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an old man begins with an abbreviation of the character for somebody, the nose having been shortened into a simple criss-cross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the soil drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when “dust to dust” begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal walking stick for getting around; and the spoon for being spoon-fed. [6];;As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements: .
者;Old man . . . sun. This key word looks difficult because of its proximity to somebody. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun “something.” [8];puppet;As a primitive it means a _puppet_-on-a-string.
;;husband;This primitive is based on that for _husband_. The two extra strokes represent a pair of **scissors **he is carrying around. [6]
;;drop;To remember with this primitive meaning, you might picture a tuxedo-clad **maestro** waving his baton about wildly. The baton is, of course, the little _drop_ at the top. And the two boxes attached to the long vertical stroke may represent his tuxedo tails, if you wish. [6]
足;Mouth . . . mending. Note that the last stroke of mouth and the first of mending overlap. [7];human,wooden,walking,leg,legs,animal;As a primitive on the left, it is amended to . Its meaning remains _leg_, but should be thought of as a _wooden_ _leg_ in order to avoid confusion with other similar elements, namely _human_ _legs_, _animal_ _legs_, and _walking_ _legs_.
咼;;cowl,mouth;The meaning of this primitive is taken from the combination of “the joint” above and the _mouth_ in the _cowl_ below. [9]
阝;;;This key word has been chosen because of its connotation of “the highest point,” thereby suggesting the image of the highest point in a village, that is, a hill or mountain on which sacred or festive events take place. If you have a clear image of the Athenian acropolis, you might use it to express this element for a **pinnacle**. Note that this primitive appears only on the left. On the right, as we shall see later, the same form takes a different meaning. [3]
穴;House . . . eight. [5];eight,human,legs;As a primitive, this kanji uses an alternate form: the primitive for _eight_ is replaced with that for _human_ _legs_.
;;eight,human legs,hole;This primitive simply discards the first stroke of that for _hole_ to become a **paper punch**. When found at the top of its relative primitive, it undergoes the same change, the _eight_ becoming _human legs_ (see frame 1413). [4]
幺;;thread;The two triangular shapes here and their final stroke are intended as a pictograph of a **cocoon**, spun in circles and tied up at the end. It is like the character for _thread_, except that the silkworm’s actual product has not yet emerged clearly at the bottom. [3]
幾;Two cocoons . . . person . . . fiesta. [12];abacus,many,how;As a primitive, this kanji will mean an _abacus_, the bead-instrument used in the Orient to calculate _how_ _many_.
系;The single stroke (an eyedropper) added to the beginning of the primitive for thread gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, lineage. [7];yarn;As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of _yarn_, as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with _yarn_.
卩;;;This character is a kind of pictograph of a **stamp** that may best be imagined as a postage **stamp** to distinguish it from other stamp-like things to come up later. [2]
;;,stamp;The **chop-seal** is the engraved piece of wood or stone used in the Orient to certify documents. Unlike the _stamp_, the top stroke here reaches a good distance to the left of its vertical stroke. When it appears at the top of another primitive, it is abbreviated to _._ [2]
;;stamp;The primitive for **fingerprint** is like that for _stamp_ except that the second stroke bends back towards the right, like an arm. [2]
;;evening    fingerprint;_Evening . . . fingerprint_. [5]
;;stamp;This primitive element is actually the mirror-image of that for _stamp_, but since Japanese does not permit a stroke to go to the left and bottom in one swoop, the visual similarity is not perfectly clear. If you play with the idea with pen and paper, its logic will become obvious. [3]
;;;This primitive represents a number of small **staples**, like the kind commonly used in an office and at school. [4]
酉;Though we shall later encounter the kanji for bird, we introduce this one for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning. [7];whiskey,bottle;As a primitive, it means _whiskey_ _bottle_. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle, and the contents (about one-third full). You might also think of the Spanish “porrón,” a decanter shaped like a long- necked bird.
豆;This kanji depicts a pot of beans, although it looks more like a table on which the pot is resting. [7];table;As a primitive, this kanji will also mean _table._
;;samurai,table;The element for **drum** shows a _samurai_ over a _table_. The top stroke of the _table_ appears to be missing, but actually it has doubled up with the final stroke of the element for _samurai_. [9]
艮;;;We give this element the meaning of **silver** from the kanji in the following frame. Both the original pictographic representation and the primitive elements that make it up are more trouble to hunt out than they are worth. It is best simply to learn it as is. In doing so, take careful note of the stroke order, and also the fact that when this element appears on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us simply _._ [6]
良;Drop of . . . silver. [7];silver,halo;As a primitive, use the image of a saint’s _halo_. As with _silver_, when this element is drawn on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us .
食;If halo and umbrella aren’t enough, break the halo down into drop and silver-- or “silverware,” an additional primitive. [9];silver,eating,food;As a primitive the kanji means _eating_ or _food_. As with _silver,_ on the left the final two strokes are combined into one.
;;receipt,human,waiter,legs;If you draw this character once, you will see that its first three strokes resemble the form for _receipt_ (except that the third stroke ends more parallel to the first), with its last stroke stretched to form the first of the two _human_ _legs_. From this we give it its meaning of a **waitress** (who should not be confused with the _waiter_ back in frame 1050). [5]
平;This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of even. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater. [5];water lily;As a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a _water lily_.
;;;These two strokes are a crude drawing of a bundle of stalks bound together into a **sheaf**. [2]
屯;;drop,of    shovel    fishhook;_Drop_ _of . . . shovel . . . fishhook_. [4]
辛;The character in this frame pictures food whose taste is so hot and spicy that it makes the hairs on your body stand up as straight as needles. [7];,pepper,red,spicy;As a primitive, we shall use this meaning of _spicy_, except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree: _._ Then we take its alternate meaning of a _red_ _pepper_ plant. The connection is obvious.
辟;;spicy,mouth,flag;One way American children learn to cope with food they are forced to eat against their will is to smother it with **ketchup**. We can see this depicted in the _mouth_ with the _flag_ over it (in this case, the Stars and Stripes), set alongside the element for _spicy_ (all of which is not far removed from the original meaning it had as a character on its own: “false”). [13]
;;;Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a **cornucopia**. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]
;;human,soil,legs;As we mentioned back in frame 249, **rice seedlings** get an element all their own: _soil_ and _human_ _legs_ becomes an ideograph of the spikelets of rice bunched together for implanting in the muddy soil of the paddy. [5]
亥;This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the sign of the hog. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating hog in connection with the primitive meaning given below. [6];elbow,top hat,person,acorn;The _top hat_ represents the external shape of the _acorn, _and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an _elbow_ and _person_) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the _acorn_ contains the oak tree in a nutshell.
;;pole,tree;This _tree_ has become a _pole_ (that is, a _tree_ with its branches not touching) because most of its branches have been pruned off by a naive but greedy gardener anxious to siphon off its **resin** (the drop at the top, written as the final stroke) as quickly as possible. [5]
;;salad;This primitive looks very close to that for _salad_, except that an extra horizontal line has been included, reminiscent I should think of the long **celery** sticks in your _salad_. [5]
;;scarf,celery,eight,top hat;This unusual looking **grass skirt** is composed of a _top hat_ and _scarf_, and _eight_ _celery_ sticks. [13]
;;soil;As the plant **grows up** it sprouts leaves and a stalk, which are depicted here over a single horizontal stroke for the _soil_. Think of something (its relative primitive) **growing up** in a flash to many times its normal size, much like little Alice in Wonderland, who **grew up** so fast she was soon larger than the room in which she was sitting. [4]
生;A single drop added to the element for grow up gives us the character for life. [5];up,grows,cell;As a primitive, we may think of a microscopic _cell_, that miraculous unit that _grows_ _up_ to become a living being.
丰;;up,hedge,grow;Whatever image you contrived for the character meaning _hedge_ (frame 165), choose something different and clearly distinguishable for this primitive for **bushes**. The element itself differs from that for _grow_ _up_ only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing. Though we shall meet only one instance of it in this chapter and one more later on, it is worth noting that when this element appears on the side, the final stroke is sloped somewhat to the left: . [4]
耒;;bushes,tree,bush;The addition of the final two strokes to the element for _bushes_ gives the sense of a _tree_ that is also a _bush_. Hence, the **Christmas tree**. [6]
;;bushes;The element for _bushes_ has an extra stroke added (drawn down from the middle of the second stroke when it “encloses” something beneath, otherwise from the point where the third and fourth strokes intersect) to give the image of the crutches Japanese gardeners use to hold up a tree that is being bent into shape. From there it is but a short leap to the small bonsai** **plants that imitate this art in miniature. [5]
;;bushes;The element for _bushes_ extended the vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke; the **cornstalk** omits that final stroke altogether, leaving only the **stalk** and the leaves bursting forth on all sides. [3]
;;mouth,up,flower,grow;The _flower_, the _mouth_, and the element for _grow_ _up_ combine here to create the primitive for **cabbage**. [10]
;;cabbage;By twisting the final two strokes of our _cabbage_ into a pair of legs, we get a **scarecrow** with a _cabbage_ for a head. [10]
;;;The drawing of this element is difficult to do smoothly, and should be practiced carefully. It is a pictograph of all sorts of plants and grasses thrown together to make **silage**. The vertical stroke is drawn here with a broken line to indicate that it will always double up with another primitive element’s vertical stroke. [6]
今;The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes--for instance, as the second stroke of mouth. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is now. The element above it, meeting, should easily relate to that image. [4];clock;We shall use _clock_ as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.
西;To our way of counting directions, the west always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for four in this kanji. But since we want only one of the four directions, the west adds the one at the top and sucks the human legs a bit out of their mouth in the process. [6];old,mouth,east,west,the east,legs;As a primitive, the meaning of _west_ can be expanded to refer to the _Old_ _West_ of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for _east_ was expanded into _the East. _Note, however, that in its primitive form the _legs_ are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the _mouth_. Hence, we get the shape . With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.
門;The pictograph of two swinging gates is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The gates usually serve as an enclosure, and are written before whatever it is they enclose. [8];door,gates;As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of _gates_, but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for _door_.
非;This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to “un-” is but a short step. [8];cell,jail;As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of _jail_ _cell_.
;;five;This element gets its name and meaning from its pictographic representation of a **key**. The shape should be familiar: it is none other than the third and fourth strokes of the kanji for _five_. [2]
;;st bernard,key;This element depicts a large, sharpened _key_ coming down on the head of a criminal _St. Bernard_. [4]
韋;;sunglasses,with one of the lenses popped out,key,mouth;The vertical stroke added here (the third stroke) turns the primitive element for a _key_ into a **locket**. Below that, we find a square container (the _mouth_) and _sunglasses_ _with one of the lenses popped out._ Note that in the primitive element for **locket **the final vertical stroke of _sunglasses _reaches all the way through to touch the _mouth._ [10]
干;It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind’s eye to give it the connotation of to dry. [3];clothesline;The primitive meaning is _clothesline_.
于;;dry;Note how this element differs from _dry_ in virtue of the small hook at the end of the third stroke. [3]
余;Umbrella . . . potato . . . little. The last stroke of potato and the first of little coincide in this character. [7];much,scale,too;Since the phrase “_too_ _much_” is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a _scale_ whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because _too_ _much_ weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself.
;;meeting    mouth    person,person,mouth,bundle;We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for _bundle_. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: _meeting . . . mouth . . . person. _The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the _person_ runs through the _mouth. _[8]
疒;;ice,cave;The enclosure shown in this frame is composed of a _cave_ with _ice_ outside of it. It is used for a number of kanji related to **sickness**. If you want to picture a _cave_man nursing a hangover with an _ice_-pack, that should provide enough help to remember the shape of this element and its meaning. [5]
匚;;;This enclosure, open at the right, represents a **box** lying on its side. When it is not used as an enclosure, its form is cramped to look like this: . You may distinguish its meaning by picturing it then as a very small **box**. [2]
癶;;;The dots at the top of this tent are the wooden poles protruding outside the canvas walls of a **teepee**. [5]
尞;;little,dog,st bernard,teepee,sun;The _St. Bernard_ _dog_ and its overlapping with the element for _teepee_ are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a **pup tent**. The combination of _sun_ and _little_ at the bottom can be seen as a _little_ opening or flap through which the _sun_ shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12]
彡;;hair;The three simple strokes of this element actually represent the form or **shape** of the hair of one’s beard. But we keep the simple sense of a **shape**, or its verb “to **shape**,” in order to avoid confusion later when we meet an element for _hair_. When using this element, be sure to visualize yourself **shaping** the thing in question, or better still, twisting it out of **shape**. [3]
文;Under the familiar top hat we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it. It can be associated with sentence by thinking of a sentence as a grammatical pattern. [4];plaid;The primitive meaning for this character will be _plaid_, the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles.
;;walking sticks;This element means just what it looks like: two **fenceposts**. They enclose whatever comes between them, as distinct from a pair of _walking sticks_ (see frame 265). [2]
;;;As the pictograph itself immediately suggests, this element depicts spreading out or scattering from a focal point. To capture this meaning, we choose the image of a **sparkler**. It will often have another primitive put at its center point. [4]
赤;Ground . . . dagger . . . little. The two strokes of the dagger take the place of the middle stroke of little. [7];,apple;As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form. Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot, giving us 亦_._ This latter form will take the meaning of an _apple_.
巴;;snake;This element is shaped roughly like the _snake_, but pay attention to the difference when writing it. [4]
甘;This kanji is a pictograph of a small wicker basket. (The extra short stroke in the middle helps keep it distinct from the character for twenty.) All one needs to add is some image of sweet cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with confectionary (frame 1203). [5];basket,wicker;As a primitive, the pictograph’s meaning of a _wicker_ _basket_ is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics.
其;;wicker,basket,legs;As the two _legs_ at the bottom suggest, this **bushel basket** is a large container, standing on the floor. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small _wicker_ _basket_ introduced just above. To make room for something inside of the **bushel basket**, the legs at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make an enclosure. [8]
;;in;By adding a single stroke at the bottom of the kanji for _in_, we get a sort of pictograph of a **purse**. [5]
且;;eye;The pictographic representation in the primitive shown here is a small stand with horizontal **shelves**. Thus we give it the general meaning of a **shelf**. It differs from the kanji and primitive for an _eye_ only in its final stroke, which extends beyond the two vertical strokes at both ends. Think of it as a **shelf** for special keepsakes or a glass bureau for knickknacks, keeping it distinct from the kanji we learned in frame 214. [5]
並;This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for stand up. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done. [8];,upside,row,a,in,down;The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears beneath its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it: _._ atop its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced below the primitive’s bottom line: _._ We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to _upside_ _down_ _in_ _a_ _row_.
共;Salad . . . animal legs. [6];bushel,strung,together,basket;The primitive retains the meaning of _together_. Imagine things _strung_ _together_ like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with _bushel_ _basket_, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.
角;Bound up . . . glass canopy . . . walking stick . . . two. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for soil, which would prompt you to write it in improper order. [7];angles;As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-_angles._
冓;;celery    again;_Celery . . . again_. [10]
;;flower,canopy    flower,glass;_Glass_ _canopy . . . flower_. It is most rare to see the _flower_ come under its relative element. Note how it is straightened out to fill the space available. [5]
氐;;family,name    floor;_Family_ _name . . . floor_. [5]
甫;;screwdriver,arrowhead;This primitive refers to all sorts of identification tags, but **dog tag** is chosen for its descriptiveness. On the top we see the _arrowhead_, joined to the _screwdriver_ below by the lengthened vertical stroke. [7]
阝;;pinnacle;On the left, and rather more pressed in its form, this element meant the high spot of a village, or its _pinnacle._ On the right side, in the form shown here, it means the lowest part of the city, around which its walls rise up as a protection against invaders. Hence we nickname this element: **city walls**. [3]
;;cliff,drop,person,;Although not a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from _cliff_ and _person_ because of this **dragging** effect, not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long _drop_. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: _._ [2]
;;hook;This element, which looks something like a backwards _hook, _we will call a **clothes hanger**. Used as an enclosure, it begins further to the left. [1]
牙;f you play with this primitive’s form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a box-like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the halberd, a convenient combination for the tusk protruding from the mouth of an animal. [4];;Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4--but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.
釆;;a drop of    rice,footprints;Having already met the primitive for human _footprints_, we now introduce the one for **animal tracks**. Its elements are simply: _a drop of . . . rice_. [7]
番;This key word has been chosen for its overlay of several meanings similar to those of the kanji: a turn of duty, a round, a number, and so forth. Its composite elements: animal tracks . . . rice field. [12];dice,turn;As a primitive element, we choose the image of a pair of _dice_ which it is your _turn_ to throw.
;;a drop of    rice,footprints;Having already met the primitive for human _footprints_, we now introduce the one for **animal tracks**. Its elements are simply: _a drop of . . . rice_. [7]
;;feathers;So as not to confuse this primitive element with the character for _feathers_, think of the extravagant **tail-feather **plumage of the peacock. The form itself is too pictographic to need breaking down further. [5]
;;scarf;Here we have a quasi-pictograph of the colorful and decorated clips used to bind up long hair. Note its similarity to the _scarf_, which differs only by the addition of one stroke. [4]
長;In line with the story of the preceding frame, the hair that needs the hairpin is long. [8];mane,hair;The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. It is often abbreviated to the form  and will mean _hair_. Further abbreviated to , it will mean the long, mangy _mane_ of an animal.
;;schoolhouse,vulture,claw;We have met these three strokes before. When they come under another stroke, they represent a _claw_, and thence a _vulture._ And when placed atop a roof structure, they create a _schoolhouse._ The **owl** has something to do with both: it is a bird of prey, and it has come to be associated with learning. [3]
;;claws,friendship;This primitive is simplicity itself. It depicts bird _claws_ that are joined to one another. Note the extra horizontal stroke in _friendship, _which gives the appearance of a “two” in the middle of the kanji, further emphasizing the togetherness of the **migrating ducks**. [9]
;;animal,mountain,horns;The _animal_ _horns_ and _mountain_ unite, quite naturally, to give us a **mountain goat**. The extension of the final stroke indicates its tail, which only shows up when it has something under it. In an overhead enclosure, it is to be pictured as standing still, so that its tail droops down and out of sight. [6]
;;mountain,king,vulture    king    mountain;_Vulture . . . king . . . mountain_. By now you should be used to finding two elements double up on a stroke, as is the case here with _king_ and _mountain_. [9]
豸;;sow,claw;This primitive represents a **skunk** by combining the _claw_ with the first part of the element for a _sow_. Note how the final stroke of _claw_ is turned and lengthened to double up with the first stroke of the _sow_. [7]
免;This character is used for excusing oneself for a failure of courtesy. The elements are: bound up . . . sun (oddly enough, laid on its side) . . . human legs. [8];rabbit;For the primitive meaning, we shall refer to this character as a _rabbit_, for which the old form of the character is 兔.
馬;Let the extra vertical stroke in the mane combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the horse’s long neck. The only odd thing is the tail feathers at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of mane and the first of tail feathers coincide should no longer surprise you. [10];horse,horses,of,team;As a primitive, this kanji will mean a _team_ _of_ _horses_ as distinct from the single _horse_ whose primitive we met earlier.
虎;The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the magic wand) who decided to make a tiger. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (diced into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated tiger promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless human legs). Whatever the parable’s significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji.;human,tiger,legs;As a primitive element itself, the _human_ _legs_ are also swallowed up, but the meaning of _tiger_ is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath, , giving the _tiger _something else to eat.
鹿;Drawn on the walls of a complex of caves near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of deer, some of them showing men in deer masks. By comparing their drawings to real deer, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by comparing themselves to the deer, to take on that animal’s characteristics. But time has locked with a “double-key” (the extra stroke through the element for key) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which caves, a double-key, and comparing gives us the kanji for deer. [11];deer,of,tiger,painting,a;As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the _tiger_ was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement: . Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: _painting_ _of_ _a_ _deer_.
;;animal horns,heavens;The story is told of the people of the Exodus that, disstisfied with Moses’ leadership, they colleted their gold ornaments and melted them down to fashion a **golden calf **for an idol. The _animal horns_ and _heavens _here represent that god of theirs. [6]
