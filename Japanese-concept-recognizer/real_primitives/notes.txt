floor, ceiling;一;* As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of _floor_ or _ceiling_ , depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means _ceiling_ , if below, _floor_.
human legs;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/human%20legs.png}};Notice how these **human legs** are somewhat shapelier and more highly evolved than those of the so-called “lower animals.” The one on the left, drawn first, is straight
mouth;口;* As a primitive, this form also means _mouth_. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning.
top hat;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/top%20hat.png}};The broad rim and tall top of the **top hat** is pictured graphically here in these two simple strokes.
animal legs;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/animal%20legs.png}};Like the four that follow it, this primitive is not a kanji in its own right, though it is said to be derived from 八, the character we learned earlier for _eight_. It always comes at the bottom of the primitive to which it is related. It can mean the **legs** of any kind of **animal**: from a grizzly bear’s paws to an octopus’s tentacles to the spindle shanks of a spider. (The one animal not allowed is our friend homo sapiens, whose legs figure in the next frame.) Even where the term “legs”** **will apply metaphorically to the legs of pieces of furniture, it is best to keep the association with **animal legs**. (You may review frame 6 here.) [2]
diced, cut;七;* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of _diced_ , i.e., "cut" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for _cut_ to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89).
baseball team, baseball, nine;九;* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean _baseball team_ or simply _baseball_. The meaning, of course, is derived from the _nine_ players who make up a team.
ten, needle;十;* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of _ten_ and sometimes signifies _needle_ , this latter derived from the kanji for _needle_ (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.
sun, day, tongue wagging in the mouth;日;* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean _sun_ or _day_ or a _tongue wagging in the mouth_. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like  "sayeth" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620).
moon, flesh, part of the body;月;* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of _moon_ , _flesh_ , or _part of the body_. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.
rice field, brains;田;* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of _rice field_ is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of _brains_ from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.
eye, eyeball;目;* As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of _eye_ , or more specifically, an _eyeball_. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side.
walking stick;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/walking%20stick.png}};This primitive element is a picture of just what it looks like: a cane or **walking stick**. It carries with it the connotations of lameness and whatever else one associates with the use of a cane. Rarely--but very rarely-- it will be laid on its side. Whenever this occurs, it will always be driven through the middle of some other primitive element. In this way, you need not worry about confusing it with the primitive meanings of _one. _[1]
a drop of;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/drop%20of.png}};The meaning of this primitive is obvious from the first moment you look at it, though just what it will be **a drop of** will differ from case to case. The important thing is not to think of it as something insignificant like a “drop in the bucket” but as something so important that it can change the whole picture--like **a drop of** arsenic in your mother-in-law’s coffee. [1]
acupuncturist;博;* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the _needle_ on the left and gets the meaning of an _acupuncturist_.
divining rod;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/divining%20rod.png}};This is a picture of a **divining rod**_,_ composed of _a drop_ and a _walking stick_, but easy enough to remember as a pictograph. Alternately, you can think of it as a **magic wand**. In either case, it should suggest images of magic or fortune-telling.
mist;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mist.png}};Here is our second example of a primitive composed of other primitives but not itself a kanji. At the bottom is the primitive (also a kanji) for _early _or _sunflower_. At the top, a _needle_. Conveniently, **mist** falls _early _in the morning, like little _needles_ of rain, to assure that the _sunflower_ blooms _early _as we have learned it should. [8]
wind;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/wind%3B%20weather%20vain.png}};This primitive gets its name from the full kanji for the **wind** (frame 563). It is called an “enclosure” because other elements are often drawn in the middle of it, though it can also be compressed together so that there is no room for anything in it. The main thing to remember when writing this element is that the second stroke bends outwards, like a gust of **wind **blown from above. In addition to the basic meaning of **wind**_, _we shall also have occasion to use the image of a **weather vane**. The derivation is obvious. [2]
bound up;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/bound%20up.png}};Like _wind, _the element meaning **bound up** is also an enclosure that can wrap itself around other elements or be compressed when there is nothing to enclose. When this latter happens--usually because there is not enough room-- and it is set on top, the little hook at the end is dropped off, like this: 聴.
horns;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/horns.png}};This primitive element always appears at the top of the element to which it is related, and is always attached, or almost attached, to the first horizontal line to come under it. The **horns** can never simply be left hanging in the air. When there is no line available, an extra horizontal stroke (like a _one_) is added. The final kanji of this lesson gives an example.
whirlwind;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/whirlwind.png}};A formal high silk _top hat_ resting atop a _weather vane _represents a **whirlwind**. To keep it distinct from the primitive for _wind_, try to picture the vortex, or tornado-like spinning movement, of a **whirlwind**. The next frame should help. [4]
schoolhouse;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/schoolhouse.png}};Here we see a little red **schoolhouse** with the 3 dots on the roof. As you write it in the following frames, you should acquire a “feel” for the way the first two short strokes move left to right, and the third one right to left. Write it twice now, saying to yourself the first time as you write the first 3 strokes, “In the **schoolhouse **we learn our A-B-Cs,” and the second time, “In the **schoolhouse **we learn our 1-2-3s.” [5]
brush;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/brush.png}};This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing **brush**. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the **brush**, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of _cow_, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its “tail” is cut off, giving us _._ [6]
taskmaster;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/taskmaster.png}};First find the long rod (the first stroke), held in the hand of someone seated (the next 3 strokes, not unlike the pictograph for _woman_, but quite different from that for _walking_ _legs_ introduced in Lesson 13). The only thing left to do is conjure up the memory of some **taskmaster** (or taskmistress) from your past whom you will “never forget.” [4]
arrow;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/arrow.png}};Here we see a pictograph of a long and slightly warped **arrow**. By extending the short final stroke in both directions, you should see the **arrow**head without any difficulty. The hook at the bottom represents the feathers at the butt end. When it serves as a semi-enclosure for other primitives, the first stroke is drawn longer, as we shall see in the following frames. [3]
quiver;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/quiver.png}};This primitive is easy to remember as depicting something used to bring all one’s _arrows_ together into _one_ handy place: the **quiver**. [4]
fiesta;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/fiesta.png}};The picture in this primitive is what we may call a “tassled _arrow_.” A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an _arrow_ to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a **fiesta**. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semi-enclosure. [4]
Thanksgiving;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/thanksgiving.png}};I choose the word **Thanksgiving **as only one possible way of making this primitive more concrete. The sense, as its composite primitives make clear, is of a “_land_ _fiesta_,” or a harvest feast. If you choose a word of your own, make sure it does not conflict with _fiesta_. [6]
parade;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/parade.png}};Note first the order of the writing. The first stroke, added to _fiesta,_ gives us a full-fledged enclosure, because of which we should always think of this as a **parade of **something or other, namely whatever is inside the enclosure. [5]
march;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/march.png}};As distinct from the _parade_, the **march **points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the _parade_. The inclusion of the _one_ gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the **march**. As was the case with _parade, _the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is **marching**. [6]
float;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/float.png}};The **floats **that are such an important part of a _fiesta_ are shown here by the addition of the two extra horizontal strokes, which you may take as a quasi-pictographic representation of the platform structure of a **float**. [6]
mending;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mending.png}};This primitive differs from the kanji for _correct_ only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the “-ing” of **mending **if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like **mending** holes in socks. [5]
stretch;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/stretch.png}};The primitive meaning to **stretch** might at first seem similar to that for _road_. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like _road_, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3]
zoo;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/zoo.png}};To avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up, this primitive will signify a **zoo**. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from _mending._ Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]
apron;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/apron.png}};The _towel _that has edges jagged like little _crowns_ is the cook’s **apron**. [5]
belt;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/belt.png}};This primitive, clearly derived from that for _towel_, is always hung on another vertical stroke, and takes the meaning of a **belt**. [2]
rising cloud;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/rising%20cloud.png}};This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a **cloud **of something **rising **upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4]
ice;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/ice.png}};The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean _water_ into two drops signals the solidifying of _water_ into **ice**. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for _water_, 冫, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the _water_ primitive: _._ [2]
angel;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/angel.png}};The sense of the primitive, **angel**, derives from the primitive for _witch_ replacing the _top hat_ in the character for _tall_. [12]
antique;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/antique.png}};The primitive meaning **antique**, not itself a kanji, depicts a _vase_ kept under a _glass_ _hood_ because it is very, very _old_. [11]
siesta;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/siesta.png}};Conjure up the classic portrait of the Latin _siesta_: a muchacho _sitting_ _on_ _the_ _ground_, propped up against some building, _bound up_ from neck to ankles in a serape, one of those great, broad-rimmed mariachi hats pulled down over his face, and the noonday _sun_ beating down overhead. Always use the complete image, never simply the general sense of **siesta**. [8]
reclining;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/reclining.png}};The picture is obvious: the first stroke represents the head, and the second the body of someone **reclining**. You may also use the synonyms _lying_ or _lying_ _down_. [2]
double back;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/double%20back.png}};Either the idea of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or of folding an object in half will do. The kanji depicts someone **doubling back **to the nearest inn to _lie_ _down_ and rest a weary pair of _walking_ _legs_ after a full _day’s_ voyage. [9]
muzzle;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/muzzle.png}};The element for **muzzle **shows a _vase_ fixed over a _mouth_, perhaps with a rubber band running around the back of the head to keep it in place. [8]
kazoo;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/kazoo.png}};This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanji. It pictures the _sound_ of a _fiesta_, namely a **kazoo**. Note how the element for _sound _is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for _fiesta_. [12]
mirror;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mirror.png}};This primitive gets its meaning from the following frame. It shows a pair of _human_ _legs_ and a _tongue-wagging_ _mouth_ looking at a **mirror** _standing_ on the wall, asking perhaps who might be the fairest of them all. [11]
devil;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/devil.png}};The two _horns_ on the head of the _teenager_ are enough to suggest to most parents of adolescents a good image of a **devil**. [7]
porter;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/porter.png}};Let the extended dot at the top represent the load that the _samurai_ is carrying in his role as the master’s **porter**. [4]
scorpion;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/scorpion.png}};This primitive is a pictograph of the **scorpion**, the first 2 strokes representing its head and pincers, the last stroke its barbed tail, in which you may recognize the _fishhook_. [3]
sow;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sow.png}};Let this primitive represent a fat **sow**. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six frames. [7]
piglets;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/piglet.png}};This abbreviation of the full primitive for a _sow_, quite naturally, means **piglets**. [5]
piggy bank;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/piggy%20bank.png}};This very helpful primitive element is worth the few moments it takes to learn it. Just remember that each _day_ you put a few pennies into the back of the little _piglet_ on your bureau that you call a **piggy bank**. [9]
wool;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/wool.png}};This rather uncommon primitive is made by pulling the tail of the _sheep_ to one side to create a semi-enclosure. The meaning of **wool** is derived from the fact that the shearer is holding the _sheep_ by the tail in order to trim its **wool**. [7]
turkey;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/turkey.png}};This primitive is best remembered as an old **turkey**, complete with pipe and monocle. Its writing is somewhat peculiar, so take note of the order of the strokes. Let the first four strokes stand for the _turkey’s_ head, neck, and drooping chin. The remainder can then be pictographic of the plumage. [8]
Pegasus;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/pegasus.png}};By combining the _horse_ (giving a twist to its final stroke a bit to the left to keep the strokes from overlapping) with the _turkey_, we get a _flying_ _horse_ or **Pegasus**. Be sure not to confuse with the rarer element for _turkey house_ that was introduced in frame 609. [11]
pent in;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/pent%20in.png}};This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus **pent in**. [3]
cave;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/cave.png}};This primitive combines the _cliff_ (the last 2 strokes) with the first dot we use on the roof of the _house_. Together they make a “cliff house” or **cave**. It “encloses” its relative primitives beneath it and to the right. [3]
fingers;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/finger.png}};This alternate form of the primitive for _hand_ we shall use to represent _finger_ or _fingers_. It always appears at the left. [3]
two hands;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/two%20hands.png}};Let this primitive represent a union of **two hands**, both of which are used at the same time. Whenever this element appears at the bottom of its relative primitive, the top line is omitted, whether or not there is a horizontal line to replace it. [4]
arm;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/arm.png}};The picture of an **arm** dangling from the trunk of the body gives us the element for **arm**, or **tucked under the arm** (relative to the element below it). Examples of both usages follow. Unlike most primitives, the kanji that bears the same meaning (frame 1522) has absolutely no connection with it. [2]
missile;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/missile.png}};Although modern connotations are more suggestive, this primitive simply refers to something thrown as a weapon. Its elements: _wind . . . crotch_. [4]
spool;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/spool.png}};Here we see a simplified drawing of a **spool** (the element for _earth_ at the bottom) with threads being wound about it tightly (the _crotch_ at the top). You may remember it either pictographically or by way of the primitives. [5]
fledgling;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/fledgling.png}};The _vulture_ and _child_ combine to create the image of an aerie full of **fledglings**. [7]
birdhouse;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/birdhouse.png}};The _claw_ and crown of the roof of a _house_ (whose chimney is displaced by the _claw_) combine to give us a **birdhouse**. [6]
elbow;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/elbow.png}};This pictograph of an arm bent at the **elbow** is obvious. [2]
wall;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/wall.png}};The _elbow_ hanging under a _ceiling_ will become our element for a **wall**. [3]
infant;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/infant.png}};This primitive can be seen as an abbreviation of the full primitive for _child_, the second stroke dividing the head from the body much as it does in 子 and the other strokes condensing the long form so that it can be used atop its relative primitive. We change the meaning to **infant** to facilitate keeping the full form and its abbreviation distinct. [4]
gully;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/gully.png}};As_ _an_ _abbreviation_ _of_ _the_ _kanji_ _for_ _a_ valley_,_ _this_ _primitive_ _gets_ _its meaning_ _as_ _a_ _small_ _valley_ _or_ _**gully**._ _[5]
outhouse;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/outhouse.png}};The_ _combination_ _of_ _the_ _element_ _for_ little_,_ _the_ _basic_ “_roof” structure here (in_ _which_ _the_ _chimney_ _was_ _overwritten,_ _as it was in_ _the_ _element_ _for_ birdhouse_), combined with the_ _“window”_ _(_mouth_)_ _below,_ _gives_ _this_ _element_ _its_ _meaning_ _of_ _**outhouse**._ _Although_ _the_ _window_ _is_ _not_ _an_ _essential_ _part_ _of_ _an_ _**outhouse**,_ _I_ _think_ _you_ _will_ _agree_ _that_ _its_ _inclusion_ _is_ _a_ _boon_ _to the imagination, greatly_ _simplifying the_ _learning of_ _the_ _characters_ _in_ _which_ _it_ _appears._ _[8]
bone;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/bone.png}};This_ _character_ _is_ _meant_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _pictograph_ _of_ _a_ _**bone**_ _attached_ _to_ _a_ _piece of_ _flesh_ _(or_ _vice versa.)_ _The_ _first_ _stroke_ _serves_ _to_ _keep_ _it_ _distinct_ _from the_ _character_ _for_ evening _(frame_ _114)._ _[4]
sunglasses;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sunglasses.png}};These_ _two_ _elements_ _are_ _actually_ _the full form whose abbreviation we learned as the character_ _for_ measuring box _in_ _frame_ _42._ _To_ _the_ _left,_ _we_ _see_ _the familiar_ _shape_ _of_ evening_,_ _and_ _to_ _the_ _right_ _a_ _completely_ _new_ _shape._ _The meaning_ _we_ _have_ _assigned,_ _**sunglasses**,_ _is_ _entirely_ _arbitrary._ _[7]
wheat;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/wheat.png}};This_ _primitive_ _element will be_ _made_ _to_ _stand_ _for_ _**wheat**_. _It_ _connotes_ _a_ _special_ _grain,_ _more_ _expensive_ _than_ _ordinary_ _rice_ _and so_ _reserved_ _for_ _special_ _occasions._ _Alternatively,_ _it_ _can_ _mean_ _cereal. Its_ _form_ _is_ _like_ _that_ _for_ tree_,_ _except_ _for_ _the_ _dot_ _at_ _the_ _top_ _to represent_ _a_ _spike_ _of_ _**wheat**_ _blowing_ _in_ _the_ _wind._ _[5]
assembly line;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/assembly%20line.png}};The_ _duplication_ _of_ _the_ _kanji_ _for_ person _gives_ _us_ _this_ _primitive_ _for **assembly line**._ _Perhaps_ _you_ _can_ _imagine_ _clones_ _of_ _your_ _chosen _person _rolling off_ _an_ _assembly_ _line_ _in_ _a_ _factory._ _[4]
plow;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/plow.png}};Take_ _this_ _as_ _a_ _pictograph_ _of_ _a_ _**plow**._ _[2]
puzzle;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/puzzle.png}};Think_ _of_ _this_ _element_ _as_ _a_ _picture_ _**puzzle**_ _in_ _which_ _the_ _pieces_ _interlock. Its_ _elements:_ horns . . . two hands_._ _[6]
shredder;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/shredder.png}};The_ _element_ _on_ _the_ _left_ _looks_ _like_ rice _with_ _a_ belt _running_ _through it,_ _but_ _we_ _would_ _do_ _best_ _to_ _think_ _of_ _it_ _in_ _terms_ _of_ _its_ _writing_ _order:_ little . . . belt . . . little_._ _On_ _the_ _right,_ _of_ _course,_ _the_ taskmaster_. [12]
banner;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/banner.png}};Here_ _we_ _have_ _a_ _unique_ _enclosure_ _made_ _up_ _of_ _two_ _elements:_ compass _and_ reclining_._ _Think_ _of_ _the_ _**banner**_ _as_ _a_ _standard_ _for_ _rallying_ _around
flag;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/flag.png}};The_ _pictographic_ _representation_ _of_ _this_ _element_ _is_ _obvious._ _Provided_ _you_ _can hold_ _your_ _imagination_ _in_ _check_ _for_ _the_ _first_ _example,_ _you_ _might_ _best_ _imagine your_ _own_ _national_ _**flag**_ _in_ _composing_ _your_ _stories._ _[3]
saw;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/saw.png}};The **saw **in this primitive is distinguished from the primitive for _ax_ by the extra “teeth” on the blade. [5]
broom;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/broom.png}};The pictographic representation here is of the bristles on the head of a **broom**. Note that the second stroke stops short without cutting through the second. [3]
rake;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/rake.png}};A single vertical stroke transforms _broom_ into a **rake**. When an element comes below the **rake**, the vertical stroke is shortened, as we have seen before with other similar primitives such as _sheep_ and _cow_. Moreover, when something comes above the **rake **and joins to it at the top, the vertical stroke begins at the top horizontal stroke, as in the following two frames. [4]
sieve;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sieve.png}};A _rake_ and the _grains_ _of_ _rice_ at the bottom give us a hint of winnowing, which relates clearly to the meaning of a **sieve**. [8]
mop;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mop.png}};The only thing distinguishing a **mop** from a _rake_ is the bent handle that does not cut through the top horizontal stroke. It depicts the swish-swash motion of a **mop**. [4]
comb;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/comb.png}};The pictograph of a **comb** is clearly visible in this primitive element. [6]
shovel;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/shovel.png}};This enclosure--which embraces its relative primitive from the bottom--is a pictograph of the scoop of a **shovel**. When room permits, the arms are extended upwards to nearly the same height as the relative element it holds. [2]
salad;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/salad.png}};The element for _flowers _joins with the long horizontal stroke beneath it to create the picture of a bowl of **salad**. [4]
caverns;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/caverns.png}};The primitive for **caverns **differs from that for _cave_ by the presence of the primitive for _twenty, _suggesting a maze of underground _caves. _[7]
haystack;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/haystack.png}};The three _needles _stacked up give us a **haystack** (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the _needles_). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following frame, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as _two hands--_that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]
straw man;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/strawman.png}};The two _human legs _added to the _haystack_ (with the horizontal stroke to keep the two parts distinct from one another and avoid an ugly tangle) give us a **straw man**. [8]
quarter;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/quarter.png}};This character simply splits the vertical stroke of a _half _in half once again, to get a **quarter**. In so doing, it spreads the split stroke out to form a sort of enclosure under which its main relative primitive will be placed. It can be used either in its substantive or verbal meaning. [6]
spear;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/spear.png}};This weapon, which has the appearance of the long _saber_ but is drawn slightly differently, depicts a **spear**. It appears very rarely--in fact, only twice and both instances are given in the following frames. [2]
dollar sign;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/dollarsign.png}};Composed of two _walking sticks _running through a _bow, _this character is infrequent as a primitive, and yet easy to remember for what it looks like (which is also what the Japanese adopted it to mean in days gone by): the **dollar **sign, $. When it is written under another element, the first vertical stroke is abbreviated to a short “tail” as the final stroke, and the second vertical stroke is cut off at the top. Examples follow in frames 1327 and 1328. [5]
snare;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/snare.png}};The simple **snare** composed of a piece of vine and a bent twig is depicted here as a sort of abbreviation of the _bow, _to which it is related. [2]
slingshot;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/slingshot.png}};The **slingshot** differs from the _snare_ by virtue of the first stroke, which you may take as the strip of rubber you pull back on, to make the **slingshot **sling. [2]
scissors;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/scissors.png}};This primitive is based on that for _husband_. The two extra strokes represent a pair of **scissors **he is carrying around. [6]
maestro;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/maestro.png}};To remember with this primitive meaning, you might picture a tuxedo-clad **maestro** waving his baton about wildly. The baton is, of course, the little _drop_ at the top. And the two boxes attached to the long vertical stroke may represent his tuxedo tails, if you wish. [6]
jawbone;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/jawbone.png}};The meaning of this primitive is taken from the combination of “the joint” above and the _mouth_ in the _cowl_ below. [9]
pinnacle;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/pinnacle.png}};This key word has been chosen because of its connotation of “the highest point,” thereby suggesting the image of the highest point in a village, that is, a hill or mountain on which sacred or festive events take place. If you have a clear image of the Athenian acropolis, you might use it to express this element for a **pinnacle**. Note that this primitive appears only on the left. On the right, as we shall see later, the same form takes a different meaning. [3]
paper punch;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/miss%20universe%3B%20paper%20punch.png}};This primitive simply discards the first stroke of that for _hole_ to become a **paper punch**. When found at the top of its relative primitive, it undergoes the same change, the _eight_ becoming _human legs_ (see frame 1413). [4]
cocoon;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/cocoon.png}};The two triangular shapes here and their final stroke are intended as a pictograph of a **cocoon**, spun in circles and tied up at the end. It is like the character for _thread_, except that the silkworm’s actual product has not yet emerged clearly at the bottom. [3]
stamp;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/stamp.png}};This character is a kind of pictograph of a **stamp** that may best be imagined as a postage **stamp** to distinguish it from other stamp-like things to come up later. [2]
chop-seal;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/chop-seal.png}};The **chop-seal** is the engraved piece of wood or stone used in the Orient to certify documents. Unlike the _stamp_, the top stroke here reaches a good distance to the left of its vertical stroke. When it appears at the top of another primitive, it is abbreviated to {{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/chop-seal%20small.png}}_._ [2]
fingerprint;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/fingerprint.png}};The primitive for **fingerprint** is like that for _stamp_ except that the second stroke bends back towards the right, like an arm. [2]
receipt;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/receipt.png}};This primitive element is actually the mirror-image of that for _stamp_, but since Japanese does not permit a stroke to go to the left and bottom in one swoop, the visual similarity is not perfectly clear. If you play with the idea with pen and paper, its logic will become obvious. [3]
staples;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/staples.png}};This primitive represents a number of small **staples**, like the kind commonly used in an office and at school. [4]
drum;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/drum.png}};The element for **drum** shows a _samurai_ over a _table_. The top stroke of the _table_ appears to be missing, but actually it has doubled up with the final stroke of the element for _samurai_. [9]
silver;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/silver.png}};We give this element the meaning of **silver** from the kanji in the following frame. Both the original pictographic representation and the primitive elements that make it up are more trouble to hunt out than they are worth. It is best simply to learn it as is. In doing so, take careful note of the stroke order, and also the fact that when this element appears on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us simply _._ [6]
waitress;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/waitress.png}};If you draw this character once, you will see that its first three strokes resemble the form for _receipt_ (except that the third stroke ends more parallel to the first), with its last stroke stretched to form the first of the two _human_ _legs_. From this we give it its meaning of a **waitress** (who should not be confused with the _waiter_ back in frame 1050). [5]
sheaf;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sheaf.png}};These two strokes are a crude drawing of a bundle of stalks bound together into a **sheaf**. [2]
ketchup;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/ketchup.png}};One way American children learn to cope with food they are forced to eat against their will is to smother it with **ketchup**. We can see this depicted in the _mouth_ with the _flag_ over it (in this case, the Stars and Stripes), set alongside the element for _spicy_ (all of which is not far removed from the original meaning it had as a character on its own: “false”). [13]
cornucopia;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/cornucopia.png}};Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a **cornucopia**. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]
rice seedling;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/rice%20seedling.png}};As we mentioned back in frame 249, **rice seedlings** get an element all their own: _soil_ and _human_ _legs_ becomes an ideograph of the spikelets of rice bunched together for implanting in the muddy soil of the paddy. [5]
resin;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/resin.png}};This _tree_ has become a _pole_ (that is, a _tree_ with its branches not touching) because most of its branches have been pruned off by a naive but greedy gardener anxious to siphon off its **resin** (the drop at the top, written as the final stroke) as quickly as possible. [5]
celery;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/celery.png}};This primitive looks very close to that for _salad_, except that an extra horizontal line has been included, reminiscent I should think of the long **celery** sticks in your _salad_. [5]
grass skirt;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/grass%20skirt.png}};This unusual looking **grass skirt** is composed of a _top hat_ and _scarf_, and _eight_ _celery_ sticks. [13]
grow up;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/grow.png}};As the plant **grows up** it sprouts leaves and a stalk, which are depicted here over a single horizontal stroke for the _soil_. Think of something (its relative primitive) **growing up** in a flash to many times its normal size, much like little Alice in Wonderland, who **grew up** so fast she was soon larger than the room in which she was sitting. [4]
bushes;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/bushes.png}};Whatever image you contrived for the character meaning _hedge_ (frame 165), choose something different and clearly distinguishable for this primitive for **bushes**. The element itself differs from that for _grow_ _up_ only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing. Though we shall meet only one instance of it in this chapter and one more later on, it is worth noting that when this element appears on the side, the final stroke is sloped somewhat to the left: . [4]
Christmas tree;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/christmas%20tree.png}};The addition of the final two strokes to the element for _bushes_ gives the sense of a _tree_ that is also a _bush_. Hence, the **Christmas tree**. [6]
bonsai;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/bonsai.png}};The element for _bushes_ has an extra stroke added (drawn down from the middle of the second stroke when it “encloses” something beneath, otherwise from the point where the third and fourth strokes intersect) to give the image of the crutches Japanese gardeners use to hold up a tree that is being bent into shape. From there it is but a short leap to the small bonsai** **plants that imitate this art in miniature. [5]
cornstalk;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/cornstalk.png}};The element for _bushes_ extended the vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke
cabbage;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/cabbage.png}};The _flower_, the _mouth_, and the element for _grow_ _up_ combine here to create the primitive for **cabbage**. [10]
scarecrow;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/scarecrow.png}};By twisting the final two strokes of our _cabbage_ into a pair of legs, we get a **scarecrow** with a _cabbage_ for a head. [10]
silage;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/silage.png}};The drawing of this element is difficult to do smoothly, and should be practiced carefully. It is a pictograph of all sorts of plants and grasses thrown together to make **silage**. The vertical stroke is drawn here with a broken line to indicate that it will always double up with another primitive element’s vertical stroke. [6]
key;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/key.png}};This element gets its name and meaning from its pictographic representation of a **key**. The shape should be familiar: it is none other than the third and fourth strokes of the kanji for _five_. [2]
guillotine;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/guilotine.png}};This element depicts a large, sharpened _key_ coming down on the head of a criminal _St. Bernard_. [4]
locket;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/locket.png}};The vertical stroke added here (the third stroke) turns the primitive element for a _key_ into a **locket**. Below that, we find a square container (the _mouth_) and _sunglasses_ _with one of the lenses popped out._ Note that in the primitive element for **locket **the final vertical stroke of _sunglasses _reaches all the way through to touch the _mouth._ [10]
potato;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/potato.png}};Note how this element differs from _dry_ in virtue of the small hook at the end of the third stroke. [3]
awl;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/awl.png}};We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for _bundle_. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: _meeting . . . mouth . . . person. _The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the _person_ runs through the _mouth. _[8]
sickness;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sickness.png}};The enclosure shown in this frame is composed of a _cave_ with _ice_ outside of it. It is used for a number of kanji related to **sickness**. If you want to picture a _cave_man nursing a hangover with an _ice_-pack, that should provide enough help to remember the shape of this element and its meaning. [5]
box;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/box.png}};This enclosure, open at the right, represents a **box** lying on its side. When it is not used as an enclosure, its form is cramped to look like this: . You may distinguish its meaning by picturing it then as a very small **box**. [2]
teepee;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/teepee.png}};The dots at the top of this tent are the wooden poles protruding outside the canvas walls of a **teepee**. [5]
pup tent;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/pop%20tent.png}};The _St. Bernard_ _dog_ and its overlapping with the element for _teepee_ are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a **pup tent**. The combination of _sun_ and _little_ at the bottom can be seen as a _little_ opening or flap through which the _sun_ shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12]
shape;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/shape.png}};The three simple strokes of this element actually represent the form or **shape** of the hair of one’s beard. But we keep the simple sense of a **shape**, or its verb “to **shape**,” in order to avoid confusion later when we meet an element for _hair_. When using this element, be sure to visualize yourself **shaping** the thing in question, or better still, twisting it out of **shape**. [3]
fenceposts;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/fenceposts.png}};This element means just what it looks like: two **fenceposts**. They enclose whatever comes between them, as distinct from a pair of _walking sticks_ (see frame 265). [2]
sparkler;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/sparkler.png}};As the pictograph itself immediately suggests, this element depicts spreading out or scattering from a focal point. To capture this meaning, we choose the image of a **sparkler**. It will often have another primitive put at its center point. [4]
mosaic;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mosaic.png}};This element is shaped roughly like the _snake_, but pay attention to the difference when writing it. [4]
bushel basket;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/bushel%20basket.png}};As the two _legs_ at the bottom suggest, this **bushel basket** is a large container, standing on the floor. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small _wicker_ _basket_ introduced just above. To make room for something inside of the **bushel basket**, the legs at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make an enclosure. [8]
purse;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/purse.png}};By adding a single stroke at the bottom of the kanji for _in_, we get a sort of pictograph of a **purse**. [5]
shelf;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/shelf.png}};The pictographic representation in the primitive shown here is a small stand with horizontal **shelves**. Thus we give it the general meaning of a **shelf**. It differs from the kanji and primitive for an _eye_ only in its final stroke, which extends beyond the two vertical strokes at both ends. Think of it as a **shelf** for special keepsakes or a glass bureau for knickknacks, keeping it distinct from the kanji we learned in frame 214. [5]
dog tag;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/dog%20tag.png}};This primitive refers to all sorts of identification tags, but **dog tag** is chosen for its descriptiveness. On the top we see the _arrowhead_, joined to the _screwdriver_ below by the lengthened vertical stroke. [7]
city walls;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/city%20walls.png}};On the left, and rather more pressed in its form, this element meant the high spot of a village, or its _pinnacle._ On the right side, in the form shown here, it means the lowest part of the city, around which its walls rise up as a protection against invaders. Hence we nickname this element: **city walls**. [3]
drag;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/drag.png}};Although not a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from _cliff_ and _person_ because of this **dragging** effect, not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long _drop_. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: _._ [2]
clothes hanger;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/clothes%20hanger.png}};This element, which looks something like a backwards _hook, _we will call a **clothes hanger**. Used as an enclosure, it begins further to the left. [1]
animal tracks;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/animal%20tracks.png}};Having already met the primitive for human _footprints_, we now introduce the one for **animal tracks**. Its elements are simply: _a drop of . . . rice_. [7]
lock of hair;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/lock%20of%20hair.png}};Having already met the primitive for human _footprints_, we now introduce the one for **animal tracks**. Its elements are simply: _a drop of . . . rice_. [7]
tail feathers;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/tail%20feathers.png}};So as not to confuse this primitive element with the character for _feathers_, think of the extravagant **tail-feather **plumage of the peacock. The form itself is too pictographic to need breaking down further. [5]
hairpin;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/hairpin.png}};Here we have a quasi-pictograph of the colorful and decorated clips used to bind up long hair. Note its similarity to the _scarf_, which differs only by the addition of one stroke. [4]
owl;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/owl.png}};We have met these three strokes before. When they come under another stroke, they represent a _claw_, and thence a _vulture._ And when placed atop a roof structure, they create a _schoolhouse._ The **owl** has something to do with both: it is a bird of prey, and it has come to be associated with learning. [3]
migrating ducks;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/migrating%20ducks.png}};This primitive is simplicity itself. It depicts bird _claws_ that are joined to one another. Note the extra horizontal stroke in _friendship, _which gives the appearance of a “two” in the middle of the kanji, further emphasizing the togetherness of the **migrating ducks**. [9]
mountain goat;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/mountain%20goat.png}};The _animal_ _horns_ and _mountain_ unite, quite naturally, to give us a **mountain goat**. The extension of the final stroke indicates its tail, which only shows up when it has something under it. In an overhead enclosure, it is to be pictured as standing still, so that its tail droops down and out of sight. [6]
skunk;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/skunk.png}};This primitive represents a **skunk** by combining the _claw_ with the first part of the element for a _sow_. Note how the final stroke of _claw_ is turned and lengthened to double up with the first stroke of the _sow_. [7]
golden calf;{{img:https://storage.googleapis.com/annielearn-60998.appspot.com/gold%20calf.png}};The story is told of the people of the Exodus that, disstisfied with Moses’ leadership, they colleted their gold ornaments and melted them down to fashion a **golden calf **for an idol. The _animal horns_ and _heavens _here represent that god of theirs. [6]
old;古;* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of _old_ , but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.
sunflower, early;早;* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of _sunflower_ , which was used to make the abstract key word _early_ more graphic.
oneself, nose, nostrils;自;* The same meaning of _oneself_ can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of _nose_ or _nostrils_ , both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for _nose_ (Frame 733).
white, white bird, dove, bird;白;* As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of _white_ or take the more graphic meaning of a _white bird_ or _dove_. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for _bird_ , which we shall get to later (Frame 2091).
fat man, round baseball player;丸;* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a _fat man_. Think of a grotesquely _fat man_ whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a _round baseball player_ becomes a _fat man_.
glue, glued to;寸;* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean _glue_ or _glued to_. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it.
;;
shells, oyster, clam;貝;* When used as a primitive, in addition to _shells_ , the meanings _oyster_ and _clam_ will often come in handy.
head;頁;* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a _head_ (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for _head_ (Frame 1549).
fishhook;乙;* We will keep _fishhook_ as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.
craft, I beam, artificial;工;* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of _craft_ and also takes on the related meanings of _I beam_ and _artificial_.
dagger, saber;刀;* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a _dagger_. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing _saber_ , a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).
seduce;召;* The primitive meaning remains the same: _seduce_. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.
nail, spike, street;丁;* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a _nail_ or a _spike_. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a _street_ sign out of the ground and using it as a _nail_ to repair your garage roof.
child;子;* As a primitive, the meaning of _child_ is retained, though you might imagine a little older _child_ , able to run around and get into more mischief.
woman;女;* The primitive meaning is the same: _woman_.
breasts;母;* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of _breasts_ in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.
teenager, legs;兄;* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of _teenager_ , in accord with the familiar image of the big _mouth_ and the gangling, clumsy _legs_.
little;小;* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards.
large dog, St. Bernard dog;大;* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a _large dog_ or, if you prefer, a _St. Bernard dog_. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.
evening;夕;* The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.
stone, stones, rocks;石;* The _stone_ is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of _stones_ or _rocks_ of any size or shape.
resemblance, spark, candle, fire;肖;* When used as a primitive, the sense of _resemblance_ is replaced by that of _spark_ or _candle_. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for _moon_ also carries a secondary sense of _fire_ , which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)
stream, flood;川;* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of _stream_ the more vivid image of a _flood_. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook
water;水;* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.
spring, water, little;泉;* We will keep this image of a _spring_ when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for _water_ ) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for _little_.
soil, ground, dirt, land;土;* As a primitive, the sense of _soil_ is extended to that of _ground_ because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of _dirt_ and _land_.
ivy;圭;* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean _ivy_ , that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the _ground_ to form a sort of  "second" _ground_ that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.
fireplace, hearth, conflagration, flames, cauldron, cooking fire, oven fire;火;* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a _fireplace_ (or _hearth_ ) or a raging _conflagration_ like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for _fire_ , based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean _flames_ , _cauldron_ , _cooking fire_ , or an _oven fire_.
computer, logic;里;* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a _computer_ , a meaning deriving from the kanji for _logic_ , which we will meet in Lesson 12.
monks;同;* As a primitive, this will mean _monks_ dressed in a common habit.
tree, wood, pole, wooden pole;木;* As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean _tree_ or _wood_. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to _pole_ , or _wooden pole_.
portent, turtle;兆;* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a _portent_. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a _turtle_.
chihuahua, a pack of wild dogs;犬;* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a _chihuahua_ for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of _a pack of wild dogs_.
cow;牛;* As a primitive, the same sense of _cow_ is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.
king, scepter, ball,;王;* As a primitive, this can mean either _king_ or _scepter_ , but it will usually be taken to mean _ball,_  as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.
jewel, ball;玉;* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either _jewel_ or _ball_. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.
candlestick;主;* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass _candlestick_ (with the drop representing the flame at the top).
gold, metal;金;* As a primitive, it means not only _gold_ but any _metal_ at all.
Car, cart, wagon, vehicle;車;* _Car_ , _cart_ , _wagon_ , and _vehicle_ may all be used as primitive meanings.
each;各;* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive, otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word "every," which we shall meet later in another context.
chariot;軍;* Used as a primitive this kanji means only _chariot_.
tall;高;* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of _tall_ and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes.
lap;周;* As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a _lap_.
samurai;士;* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the _samurai_ , Japan's warrior class.
aerosol can, lid, lidded crock;吉;* As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an _aerosol can_ , from the _mouth_ and the very tightly-fitting _lid_ (note how it differs here from the _lidded crock_ ).
saying, speech, words;言;* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean _saying_ , _speech_ , or _words_ , depending on which is most useful.
stop, footprint;止;* Although the meaning of _stop_ will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of _footprint_.
cloak, scarf, top hat, top hat and scarf, garment;衣;* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of _cloak_ or _scarf_ will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean _cloak_.  At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the _top hat_ ) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a _scarf_. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a _top hat and scarf_. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of _garment_ in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is  "unhooked."
rain, weather;雨;* As a primitive it can mean either _rain_ or _weather_ in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown.
heaven, heavens, witch;天;* The primitive can mean either the _heaven_ of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the _heavens_. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a _witch_.
vase, standing up;立;* Used as a primitive, it can also mean _vase_. Using its kanji meaning, think of something _standing up_ that is normally lying down, or something standing up in an unusual way.
sitting on the ground;匕;* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone _sitting on the ground_ , of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.
yawn, lack;欠;* As a primitive, it can mean either _yawn_ or _lack_.
next, second;次;* As a primitive, this character can either retain its key word meaning of _next_ or the related meaning of _second_.
sound;音;* The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.
deceased, to perish;亡;* In addition to _deceased_ , the primitive meaning of _to perish_ will also be used for this character.
compass, direction;方;* As a primitive, this character will take the sense of a _compass_ , the instrument used to determine _direction_.
increase;曽;* The primitive meaning, _increase_ , comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch.
east, East;東;* Both the direction _east_ and the part of the world called  "the _East_ " are primitive meanings of this character.
insect;虫;* As a primitive, this insect will refer to the whole _insect_ kingdom, it can be further specified for each kanji that contains it.
snake;己;* As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the _snake_  \- of which it is a pictograph - or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the _snake_ has in myth and fable.
wrap;包;* The primitive meaning of _wrap_ should always be used with the _snake_ in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let  " _wrap_ " mean "with a snake coiled about it."
eel;亀;* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean _eel_. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.)
sheep;羊;* The primitive meaning of _sheep_ can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the _cow_ , the "tail" is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: ⺷. Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame.
horse, team of horses;馬;* As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a _horse_. Any _horse_ image will do, except that of a _team of horses_ , which will come later (Frame 2132) and get its own primitive.
wings;羽;* The related image of _wings_ can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form  ョョ when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619.
heart, state of mind, valentine;心;* As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means th physical organ of the _heart_.   To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖, and means a wildly emotional _state of mind_. And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a _valentine_.
hand;手;* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single _hand_ all by itself.
genie, genius, genie in the bottle;才;* The primitive meaning, _genie_ , derives from the roots of the word _genius_. Use the _genie_ out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive, in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered, and the meaning becomes a _genie in the bottle_.
fist;乃;* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a _fist_.
outstretched hands, beg;及;* As a primitive, this shall stand for _outstretched hands_. Only take care not to confuse it with that for _beg_ (Frame 501)
crotch;又;* As a primitive, it will mean _crotch_ , as in the _crotch_ of the arm. Or whatever.
vulture, claws;爪;* As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a _vulture_ , a bird known for its powerful _claws_. It generally appears above another primitive, in which case it gets squeezed into the form ⺥.
to go in, to put in, to come in, umbrella, eight;入;* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: _to go in_ , _to put in_ , _to come in_ , and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for _umbrella_ , the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for _eight_. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.
lose;失;* As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop.
slave;臣;* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word becomes _slave_.
muscle, power;力;* As a primitive, either _muscle_ or _power_ can be used.
column, going, line, boulevard;行;* As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a _column_ , _going_ , or a _line_ of something or other. When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a _boulevard_.
rice, wheat, grains of rice, United States;米;* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of _rice_ , and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for _wheat_ that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of _rice_ far exceeds that of _wheat_.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to _grains of rice_. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for _water_. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, _grains of rice_ has 5 strokes, while _water_ only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for _rice_ is an abbreviation used for the _United States_ , which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.
flowers;竹;* As a primitive, the meaning remains the same, but the vertical lines are severely abbreviated so that they can take their place at the top where, like _flowers_ , they are always to be found.
person;人;* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of _person_ so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use _person_ for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular _person_. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.
shakuhachi;尺;* As a primitive, this will mean the _shakuhachi_ flute.
altar;示;* As a primitive, this kanji means _altar_. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the _altar_ in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, ネ, should be kept distinct from that for _cloak_ , identical except for the one final short stroke.
shoot, sprout;由;* As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean _shoot_ or _sprout_.
roots;甲;* The primitive meaning is _roots_. Important to that word is the image of  "pushing downwards," as _roots_ do.
monkey, speaketh;申;* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the "seed" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the _monkey_ (the one who _speaketh_ no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take _monkey_ as its primitive meaning.
ladle, measuring cup;斗;* Since we already have a primitive element for a "dipper" \- namely, the _ladle_ \- we shall let this one stand for a _measuring cup_. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!
screwdriver, utilized;用;* As a primitive element, we shall substitute the image of a _screwdriver_ , perhaps the most _utilized_ of all tools around the house.
building blocks;之;* In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to _building blocks_ with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child.
old man;老;* As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements.
puppet;者;* As a primitive it means a _puppet_ -on-a-string.
correct, mending, leg, wooden leg, human legs, animal legs, walking legs;足;* As a primitive on the left, it is amended to something similar to _correct_ in place of _mending_. Its meaning remains _leg_ , but should be thought of as a _wooden leg_ in order to avoid confusion with other similar elements, namely _human legs_ , _animal legs_ , and _walking legs_.
hole;穴;* As a primitive, this kanji uses an alternate form: the primitive for _eight_ is replaced with that for _human legs_.
abacus, how many;幾;* As a primitive, this kanji will mean an _abacus_ , the bead-instrument used in the Orient to calculate _how many_.
yarn;系;* As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of _yarn_ , as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with _yarn_.
whiskey bottle;酉;* As a primitive, it means _whiskey bottle_. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also think of the Spanish  "porrón," a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird.
table;豆;* As a primitive, this kanji will mean _table_.
halo, silver;良;* As a primitive, use the image of a saint's _halo_. As with _silver_ , when this element is drawn on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted.
eating, food;食;* As a primitive, this kanji can mean either _eating_ or _food_. As with _silver_ , on the left the final two strokes of this element are combined into one.
water lily;平;* As a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a _water lily_.
spicy, red pepper;辛;* As a primitive, we shall use this meaning of _spicy_ , except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree. Then we take its alternate meaning of a _red pepper_ plant. The connection is obvious.
acorn, elbow;亥;* The _top hat_ represents the external shape of the _acorn_ , and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an _elbow_ and _person_ ) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the _acorn_ contains the oak tree in a nutshell.
life;生;* As a primitive, we may think of a microscopic cell, that miraculous unit that grows up to become a living being.
clock;今;* We shall use _clock_ as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.
west, Old West, the East;西;* As a primitive, the meaning of _west_ can be expanded to refer to the _Old West_ of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for _east_ was expanded into _the East_. Note, however, that in its primitive form the _legs_ are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the _mouth_. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.
gates, door;門;* As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of _gates_ , but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for _door_.
jail cell;非;* As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of _jail cell_.
clothesline;干;* The primitive meaning is _clothesline_.
too much, scale;余;* Since the phrase " _too much_ " is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a _scale_ whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because _too much_ weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself.
plaid;文;* The primitive meaning for this character will be _plaid_ , the familiar crisscross pattern frequently used in textiles.
apple;赤;* As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form. Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot. This latter form will take the meaning of an _apple_.
wicker basket;甘;* As a primitive, the pictograph's meaning of a _wicker basket_ is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics.
upside down in a row;並;* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to _upside down in a row_.
together, strung together, bushel basket;共;* The primitive retains the meaning of _together_. Imagine things _strung together_ like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with _bushel basket_ , this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.
angles;角;* As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right- _angles_.
tusk;牙;* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.
dice, turn;番;* As a primitive element, we choose the image of a pair of _dice_ which it is your _turn_ to throw.
hair, mane;長;* The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean _hair_. Further abbreviated, it will mean the long, mangy _mane_ of an animal.
rabbit;免;* For the primitive meaning, we shall refer to this character as a _rabbit_ , for which the old form of the character is 兔.
horse;馬;* As a primitive, this kanji will mean a _team of horses_ as distinct from the single _horse_ whose primitive we met earlier.
tiger;虎;* As a primitive element itself, the _human legs_ are also swallowed up, but the meaning of _tiger_ is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the _tiger_ something else to eat.
painting of a deer;鹿;* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the _tiger_ was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: _painting of a deer_.
